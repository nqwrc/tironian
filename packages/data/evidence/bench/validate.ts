/**
 * What it would cost the authority to look at an update before storing it.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/bench/validate.ts`
 *
 * This bench exists because it was cited before it existed. `src/sync/authority.ts`
 * and `evidence/workerd/results.md` both quoted figures from a script that was
 * never committed, which makes a number an assertion wearing a measurement's
 * clothes. Everything here is reproducible or it does not belong in a comment.
 *
 * The authority makes no Yjs call at all. `evidence/validation.test.ts` covers
 * whether a check could ever be CORRECT, and finds that none can: every
 * candidate is a filter rather than a proof, because whether bytes throw depends
 * on the structs the receiver holds. This file covers the other half, what a
 * check would COST, and it is the half that turned out to be decisive.
 *
 * METHOD, following `evidence/bench/memory.ts` for the same reason it does:
 *   - One OS PROCESS PER CELL. Measuring several candidates in one process
 *     reports the allocator's high-water mark for the first and near zero after.
 *     The first version of this measurement did exactly that and produced
 *     negative heap deltas, which is the tell.
 *   - The corpus is built once and written to disk; the measuring process reads
 *     bytes, so building never peaks inside the measurement.
 *   - Baseline after a forced GC. `rss` is reported rather than `heapUsed`
 *     because the two disagree and rss is the one a Durable Object is billed on.
 *   - The answer is discarded exactly as an authority would discard it.

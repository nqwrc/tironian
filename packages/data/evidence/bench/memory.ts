/**
 * What a hydrated application document costs in memory.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/bench/memory.ts`
 *
 * METHOD, stated because the previous version of this number did not reproduce.
 * An earlier record reported 48 MB for a case an independent reviewer measured
 * at 182 MB, and neither of us had written down what we were measuring.
 *
 *   - One OS PROCESS PER CASE. Measuring several shapes in one process reports
 *     the allocator's high-water mark for the first one and near zero after,
 *     which is how the earlier figures went wrong.
 *   - The corpus is built once, written to disk as encoded bytes, and each
 *     measuring process reads those bytes. Building in-process peaks memory
 *     before the measurement starts.
 *   - The baseline is taken AFTER the bytes are read and a forced GC, so what
 *     is reported is the document, not the file.
 *   - Both `rss` and `heapUsed` are reported, because they disagree and hiding
 *     that is what made the earlier number unfalsifiable.
 *   - ITEMS is the engine-independent number and the one to quote. Memory here
 *     is driven by struct count rather than by bytes, and an item costs whatever
 *     the engine charges for a small object. Bun is JavaScriptCore; a Tauri
 *     WebView is JSC on macOS and Linux and V8 on Windows, so bytes-per-item is
 *     a property of the platform and items are a property of the data.

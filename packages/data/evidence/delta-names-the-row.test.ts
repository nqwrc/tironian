/**
 * The `'delta'` behaviour the store's per-table subscription rests on, pinned.
 *
 * Every assertion here is a property of `@y/y@14.0.0-rc.24` rather than of
 * Tironian's own code, and a failure means an upgrade moved something the
 * subscription's design is resting on rather than that the store has a bug.
 *
 * There is a specific reason to pin this one. `store.ts` correctly recorded
 * that `observeDeep` reports a nested row's field edit as an event on the TABLE
 * ROOT with `keysChanged` empty, so an `observeDeep` observer cannot name the
 * row. The conclusion drawn from it, that nothing can name the row and a remote
 * change is therefore only expressible as "some table moved", does not follow:
 * the same type emits `'delta'`, whose `attrs` is keyed by the attribute that
 * changed, and a row IS an attribute on the table root. The first half is
 * asserted here beside the second so the true observation cannot be read back
 * as the false conclusion.
 *
 * Every case carries a CONTROL: a second table whose own listener must record
 * nothing. Without it a run where the listener was never attached, or where
 * `attrs` silently became empty, would read as a pass on every assertion that
 * only checks what the watched table saw.

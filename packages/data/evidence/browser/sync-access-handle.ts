/**
 * Where a browser will let a synchronous write to durable storage happen.
 *
 * Run: `bun run evidence/browser/sync-access-handle.ts`
 *
 * This settles where a browser store's DURABLE LOG lives, and nothing else. Be
 * careful with the answer: it was briefly read as meaning a page cannot host the
 * store at all, which is false. `apps/sync-lab/ui/main.ts` is `createDeviceStore` over
 * sqlite-wasm `:memory:` on a browser main thread, deployed and working. The
 * store needs a synchronous HANDLE, not synchronous DURABILITY, and every read a
 * person makes comes from the `Y.Doc` in memory rather than from SQLite.
 *
 * What the answer does decide is whether the durable log can sit in the page
 * beside the in-memory database or has to sit behind a port. sqlite-wasm's only
 * durable backing in a browser is the origin private file system, reached
 * through `FileSystemFileHandle.createSyncAccessHandle`.
 *
 * MDN says it is "only available in Dedicated Web Workers", and this repository
 * already behaves as if that is true: `src/browser/worker.ts` installs the OPFS
 * SAH pool inside a worker. Neither is a measurement. This is.
 *
 * CONTROL: the worker arm must SUCCEED. If both arms report the handle missing,
 * the probe found a browser with no OPFS at all, or an insecure origin, and it
 * has measured its own harness rather than the platform.

/**
 * SQL over an opened definition, composed outside the store.
 *
 * A store is truth plus debts: the live document and the ledgers that must be
 * written in the same atomic act that incurs them. Everything downstream of
 * truth is a follower an application composes on the public surface, and this
 * is the first one: an in-memory SQLite the caller can `SELECT` against.
 *
 * The contract is lazy, and laziness is what makes it honest. Any committed
 * change marks the projection dirty; the next `query` rebuilds the whole
 * definition from the live document before the statement runs. There is no
 * per-edit patching and no ordering dependency on other subscribers: a read
 * repairs itself first, so `query` can never serve rows the live document has
 * moved past, from any callback, in any order. If a hot surface ever needs
 * per-row patching, it returns as an optimization behind this same contract.
 *
 * Built deliberately on nothing but the opened data's own surface (`list`,
 * `get`, `store.onCommitted`) plus the portable definition declaration. That
 * is the proof that the follower seam is complete: an FTS index, a Markdown
 * exporter, or an embedding pipeline composes the same way.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { data } = await openDevice(definition);
 * const sql = createSqliteProjection({ data, sqlite });
 * sql.query`SELECT id, title FROM notes WHERE pinned = 1`;
 * ```
 *
 * The caller supplies `sqlite` and owns closing it; construction is
 * therefore synchronous on every runtime, and the one genuinely asynchronous
 * step (initializing WASM SQLite in a browser) stays where it belongs, in the
 * caller's boot path:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const sqlite3 = await sqlite3InitModule();
 * const handle = new sqlite3.oo1.DB(':memory:');
 * const sql = createSqliteProjection({
 *   data,
 *   sqlite: adaptToSqliteDatabase(handle), // the caller's own adapter
 * });
 * ```

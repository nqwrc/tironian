/**
 * The document manager: one independent Yjs document per opaque address
 * (ADR-0248).
 *
 * A row owns one rich document at its derived address, and this manager is
 * the whole runtime for those documents: it opens fully hydrated handles,
 * reuses one live `Y.Doc` per address, persists locally authored `updateV2`
 * bytes through the store's one durable queue, accepts remote bytes from the
 * store's one connection, refuses a retired address, and unloads a document
 * when its last handle closes.
 *
 * It knows nothing about databases, tables, rows, previews, schemas, or root
 * names. An address is an opaque string it never parses; the database layer
 * composes addresses (`documentAddress`) and composes row deletion with
 * retirement. Applications name their own roots inside a document and pick
 * their own formats; concurrent first creation of one named root converges,
 * because a top-level root is addressed by its name
 * (`evidence/independent-document-roots.test.ts`), which is why no root is
 * reserved at create time.

/**
 * What a developer gets from `@epicenter/data`.
 *
 * The store and the vocabulary a data definition is declared in. Runtime
 * openers live at their own entry points, because a Bun opener imports
 * `bun:sqlite` and a browser opener imports a WASM build, and neither
 * belongs in a barrel the other has to load.
 *
 * The entry points: `.` for the surface, `./bun` and `./browser` for the
 * openers, `./projection` for the composed SQL follower, and `./engine` for
 * the construction seam test fixtures build on. The superseded stack that
 * used to answer at `./legacy` was deleted along with its consumers
 * (ADR-0227), so a developer arriving here finds one store rather than a
 * choice between two.
 *
 * Each opener is called `open` and takes the definition, because its id names
 * the store it opens (ADR-0229). The subpath already says which adapter,
 * so the identifier does not repeat it.
 *
 * `AccountStore`, `SyncCapability`, and `SyncFacts` describe the store's other
 * kind: a replica with a `sync` value rather than `undefined`. `./browser`
 * dropped its account opener (nothing in this repository dials an authority
 * from a browser anymore), so today only `./bun`'s account opener produces
 * one. The types stay exported from this barrel because they are still real
 * shapes on `./store/store.js`, published for the transport a future consumer
 * builds against that surface.

/**
 * The structured row address: the one canonical way to name a unit of
 * independent convergence (ADR-0160, ADR-0164, ADR-0206).
 *
 * An address is always a structured object, never a flat concatenated string,
 * and it is always exactly three coordinates deep: who owns it, what kind of
 * thing it is, which one. Fixed depth is what makes this a coordinate instead of
 * a path, so nothing needs traversal, prefix matching, or globbing to find
 * anything, which is the machinery ADR-0176 refuses.
 *
 * The coordinates are spelled `tableName` and `rowId` rather than `table` and
 * `row`. Each reads as the durable name it is at every call site and cannot be
 * misread as the thing it names, and `table_name` and `row_id` are the matching
 * SQL column names, so one vocabulary spans the typed API, the wire, and
 * storage.
 *
 * A database id and table are durable names a database declares. A row id comes from
 * whoever knows it: the runtime mints one when nobody does, and an application
 * supplies one when it does (ADR-0206). Renaming any coordinate produces a
 * different address, and therefore a different unit of convergence; there is no
 * rename operation and no alias.
 *
 * A table name is mounted as a SQL relation by a trusted inspection host, so it
 * must be a bare SQL identifier and `SELECT * FROM notes` must need no quoting
 * (ADR-0162). It requires a leading letter, which reserves every `_`-prefixed
 * relation name for internal use.

 * break that promise: `SELECT * FROM order` is a syntax error however carefully
 * the host generated the view. Refusing the name where it is declared is the
 * only point where the author can still fix it; refusing later would mean a
 * database that parses cleanly and then cannot be inspected.
 *
 * This is not the full keyword list, and deliberately so. SQLite accepts most of
 * its own keywords as identifiers: `rows`, `key`, `view`, `first`, `range` and
 * eighty-odd others parse fine unquoted, and refusing them would cost real
 * names for no benefit. These are the ones measured to actually fail, so the
 * rule matches the promise exactly rather than approximating it.
 *
 * The set is a property of SQLite's parser, so `addresses.test.ts` re-derives it
 * against the linked SQLite and fails if the two ever disagree. A version that
 * changes the set is then a loud test failure rather than a database that silently
 * stops being inspectable.

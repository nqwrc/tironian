/**
 * `transcribe`: the one OpenAI-compatible speech-to-text client (ADR-0050/0056/0060).
 *
 * Transcription is a service: it holds nothing and sees only the audio blob you
 * hand it. So there is one wire (`POST {baseURL}/audio/transcriptions`, multipart
 * `file`, where the connection's `baseURL` already carries `/v1`) reached through
 * the same {@link ResolvedConnection} transport that drives chat, and zero
 * per-provider adapters. OpenAI, Groq, and a self-hosted Speaches box are not three
 * code paths; they are three connections, each `resolveConnection`d to a transport
 * and handed to the same function.
 *
 * Like `listModels` and the chat engine, this consumes the *resolved* transport
 * (`{ fetch, baseURL }`), not the static `Connection`.
 * `resolveConnection` is the single boundary that turns connection data into a
 * transport, and the caller crosses it: a third-party connection resolves its own
 * key into a Bearer, and the hosted Tironian path injects its audience-scoped
 * session fetch (ADR-0053/0060), which is never connection data. So this client
 * never re-resolves and never branches on what kind of transport it got.
 *
 * Deepgram, ElevenLabs and Mistral stay bespoke in their own clients: they do not
 * speak this wire (Deepgram takes a raw body under `Authorization: Token`,
 * ElevenLabs an `xi-api-key` with `model_id`, Mistral its own SDK), and ADR-0060
 * blesses that exception. Tironian's on-device route also stays its own path: it
 * is `invoke` over the Tauri FFI into the host's transcribe.cpp GGUF engine, a
 * privileged non-wire sibling, not a `Connection`.
 *
 * This generalizes the per-provider Speaches client Tironian used to carry: the
 * name dropped and the bespoke config replaced by a transport. The error stays lean
 * and structured (it carries the HTTP `status`); an app maps a status to its own
 * user-facing copy at its toast/query layer, the library does not own that copy.

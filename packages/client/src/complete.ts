/**
 * `complete`: the one OpenAI-compatible non-streaming chat-completion client
 * (ADR-0050/0060). The single-shot sibling of `transcribe`: one
 * `POST {baseURL}/chat/completions` with a system and a user message,
 * returning the assistant's text.
 *
 * Like `transcribe` and `listModels`, this consumes the
 * *resolved* transport (`{ fetch, baseURL }`, see {@link ResolvedConnection}), not
 * a static `Connection`. `resolveConnection` is the single boundary the caller
 * crosses, so OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, and a custom OpenAI-compatible server are
 * not four code paths; they are four connections handed to the same function.
 *
 * This is the refine engine's prompt step generalized off the `openai` SDK: it
 * holds no provider knowledge and no key. A provider that does not speak this wire
 * (Anthropic, which requires `max_tokens` and returns content blocks; Google, which
 * takes one combined prompt) keeps its own bespoke client, exactly as Deepgram and
 * ElevenLabs do for transcription (ADR-0060 blesses that exception). The error stays
 * lean and structured (it carries the HTTP `status`); an app maps a status to its
 * own copy at its toast layer.

/**
 * The inference connection: a device-local, capability-orthogonal endpoint
 * (ADR-0060, amending ADR-0059). A connection is just where + how to authenticate
 * to one OpenAI-compatible server; it carries no model and no capability, so one
 * connection can drive chat, transcription, or embeddings alike. The model is the
 * conversation's (ADR-0055), paired with the transport by the caller per turn.
 *
 * There is no `kind` discriminant and no auth-strategy union. A connection is the
 * static data a human types into a form: a base URL and an optional bearer key.
 * `resolveConnection` turns that into a transport with a single, branchless rule
 * (`apiKey` -> `Authorization: Bearer`). Anything that is NOT static data, the
 * hosted Tironian gateway (an injected session fetch) and any future
 * signing/refresh auth (Bedrock SigV4, Vertex OAuth), never enters this shape: the
 * caller composes it into a {@link ResolvedConnection} and injects it. Hosted is
 * therefore not a member of this type; it is the registry's injected fallback
 * transport (see `@tironian/app-shell` `createInferenceConnections`).
 *
 * The leak guard is structural (ADR-0053): the Tironian bearer is attached only by
 * `auth.fetch`, and only to the origin it signed into. A connection here is always
 * a third-party URL reached with a plain fetch carrying only the user's own key and
 * headers, so a custom turn can never reach its URL with the Tironian bearer. The
 * single origin check lives on the credential in `fetchWithAuth`, not in this
 * resolver, so this resolver needs no hosted argument to stay safe.

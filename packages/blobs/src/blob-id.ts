/**
 * @fileoverview BlobId: the one opaque identifier a blob carries everywhere.
 *
 * A blob is minted exactly one id at record time, and that same id names the
 * object in the local store, on the optional remote, and in the row
 * that references it. The id is NOT a content hash: it says nothing about the
 * bytes, and SHA-256 or dedup never appear in this contract.
 *
 * Representation: `blob_` followed by 21 lowercase alphanumerics
 * (CSPRNG-backed nanoid, ~108.6 bits). Every character is safe as a filesystem name, an S3 key
 * segment, a URL path segment, and XML text, so implementations can use the
 * id verbatim as a storage key.
 *
 * The `blob_` prefix is runtime nominal identity: the repo's other minted ids
 * are bare 16-char nanoids, so an unprefixed BlobId would be
 * indistinguishable from a row id at every parse boundary. The prefix lets
 * the validator actually reject foreign ids instead of accepting any nanoid.
 */

 * Lowercase alphanumeric body, minted by nanoid. The 21-character body has a
 * materially larger collision envelope than the repo's device-local row ids;
 * blob ids become durable object keys across devices, stores, and apps.

 * and the arktype validator in value position (parse untrusted input with
 * `BlobId(value)` and branch on `instanceof type.errors`). Mint fresh ids with
 * {@link generateBlobId}; never cast raw strings.

/**
 * Where Tironian stores things on a machine.

 * Tironian owns exactly one application-data root. Every trusted app it runs or
 * admits receives one directory below it and owns everything inside, partitioned
 * by an identifier the external authority owns and never reuses. See ADR-0201.
 *
 * Three parties choose names along that path, and each function below is one
 * hand-off between two of them: Tironian names the root and its own
 * directories, an app names everything in its directory, and an external
 * authority names a partition. `apps/` and the partition-kind directory exist
 * because a directory whose next name is chosen by somebody else cannot be
 * defended by the party that would have to defend it. There is no level here
 * that is not one of those hand-offs.
 *
 * These are pure functions over strings and a grammar. There is no store, no
 * handle, no registry of app directories, and no lifecycle: allocating a place
 * is naming it, not owning a store, and the host never creates, opens, reads, or
 * reclaims anything below the directory it names.

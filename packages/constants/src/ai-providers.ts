/**
 * AI provider registry and model catalog for hosted chat.
 *
 * `AI_MODELS` is the single source of the live provider vocabulary: `AiProvider`
 * is derived from it, and `AI_PROVIDERS` must carry a label for every provider
 * it serves, enforced at compile time. There is no separate durable provider
 * registry: a provider retired from the catalog drops out of the vocabulary, and
 * `providerLabel` degrades its historical id to raw text at the render edge
 * rather than throwing. The model id is a free string: the OpenAI-compatible
 * gateway (ADR-0050) owns routing, so a model the backend cannot serve is a
 * runtime gateway error, not a compile error here. This catalog is the single
 * source of which ids we sell and what each costs.
 *
 * This is the build-time SEED of a layered catalog (ADR-0104): a typed `as const`
 * so `ServableModel` keeps its literal narrowing, bundled at compile time, offline,
 * present at first paint. Hosted models are authored here, never discovered: unlike
 * a custom endpoint (someone else's box, discovered via `/v1/models`, ADR-0060), we
 * own this list, and `/v1/models` cannot carry the product half (label, credits,
 * default) anyway. A runtime OVERLAY that spreads more entries on top is deliberately
 * NOT built: it is deferred until the catalog changes faster than clients ship, and
 * grafts on then with no rework (add a served projection of this const plus a merge,
 * seed-wins-on-price). Keep this a typed const, not a raw `.json` (a JSON import
 * would widen ids to `string` and lose the union).

/**
 * A Svelte 5 reactivity adapter over one opened data handle's declared shape.
 *
 * `fromData(data)` mirrors the declaration exactly: `tables.<name>` and
 * `kv`, with the names and row types the definition declares. It earns its
 * existence by adding reactivity, not by renaming anything, and the rule is
 * one sentence: every read verb tracks the table's invalidation signal, and
 * every write verb passes through unchanged.
 *
 * Reads track. `list()`, `rows`, `nonconforming`, `get()`, and `ids()` read
 * through a `createSubscriber` per table, so a read inside `$derived` or an
 * effect re-runs when a commit touches that table, whoever committed it: a
 * local write and bytes that arrived from another device alike (ADR-0221).
 * `openDocument()` is not a read: it is the store's own asynchronous load of
 * a row's independent document (ADR-0248), and it passes through untouched.
 * Prose typed inside an open document is observed on the document's own Yjs
 * types, never through a table signal.
 *
 * Writes pass through. `create`, `update`, and `delete` are the store's own
 * synchronous verbs, untouched; the commit they make is what fires the
 * invalidation the reads are subscribed to, so there is no second write path
 * and no cache to tell.
 *
 * Lazy by construction. Wrapping subscribes to nothing: a table's store
 * subscription attaches when the first effect reads it and detaches when the
 * last stops, because `createSubscriber` ref-counts subscription to effect
 * usage. A declared table no surface reads costs nothing, and the store's own
 * per-table delta hook (which is also subscription-counted) stays off too.
 * That ref-counting is the whole lifecycle: there is nothing to dispose here,
 * and the raw runtime keeps ownership of opening, sync attachment, and
 * disposal. Network operations stay on the raw plane on purpose: a reactive
 * wrapper must not pretend a rebuild or a reconnect is local state.
 *
 * One instance per opened data object, owned by whoever opened it, usually a
 * root component that provides it through context. Never a module-global
 * singleton: the data it wraps is one auth generation's document, and the
 * next generation opens its own.
 *
 * Every read is a read-through: a fresh walk over the document already in
 * memory, never a cached copy. The store flushes a commit in phases (public
 * `onCommitted` listeners before table invalidations), so any snapshot this
 * adapter kept would be observably stale to an `onCommitted` reader; holding
 * no copy makes every phase, every event handler, and every effect read the
 * same current rows. `$derived` over `rows` still memoizes its own result,
 * which is where filtering and sorting belong.
 *
 * @example
 * ```svelte
 * <script lang="ts">
 *   const workspace = fromData(data);
 *   const notes = workspace.tables.notes;
 *   const active = $derived(notes.rows.filter((n) => n.deletedAt === null));
 * </script>
 * <button onclick={() => notes.create({ title: '' })}>New</button>
 * {#each active as note (note.id)}...{/each}
 * ```
 */

/**
 * The slice of `@tironian/data`'s `TableHandle` this adapter touches: the
 * read verbs it makes reactive, and the invalidation feed it rides.
 *
 * Structural rather than imported, and that is a variance requirement, not a
 * dropped dependency edge. A typed handle narrows `create` and `update` to
 * the table's own input type, so it is not assignable to the untyped
 * `TableHandle`; constraining on the shared read surface accepts every typed
 * handle while `ReactiveTable<TTable>` preserves the caller's exact type.
 * Verbs not named here (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `document`,
 * `subscribe`) pass through the spread untouched; a read verb the store
 * grows later must be added here to become reactive.

/**
 * The exact surface of sqlite.org's OO1 `DB` this adapter drives.
 *
 * Structural rather than a type-only import of `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm`, so
 * assignability is checked at each call site against the version that caller
 * actually installed; a types-only devDependency here could silently skew
 * from the runtime the caller ships. `exec` is declared as the two call
 * shapes the adapter makes (run for effects; collect object rows), because
 * OO1's own overload set has no signature with an OPTIONAL `rowMode`: its
 * object-rows overload requires `rowMode: 'object'` and its default overload
 * forbids it, so a single merged signature is satisfiable by nothing and
 * forced a cast at every construction site.
 *
 * `transaction` takes no BEGIN qualifier. The one database this adapter ever
 * wraps is a `:memory:` projection cache with a single connection for its
 * whole life, and lock-escalation qualifiers (`IMMEDIATE`) only order writers
 * across connections; carrying one here was cross-runtime ceremony inherited
 * from the file-backed Bun adapter.
 *
 * `transaction` does not nest, and this adapter does not pretend it does. No
 * production caller nests (the store's projection rebuild is the only
 * browser-reachable transaction), OO1 itself throws loudly on a nested
 * `BEGIN`, and OO1 ships a native `savepoint()` for the day nesting earns
 * itself. The hand-rolled `SAVEPOINT tironian_nested_*` emulation that used
 * to live here served zero callers.

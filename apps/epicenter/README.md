# Epicenter desktop host

Epicenter is the repository's native application host. It owns one Tauri runtime, one native command API, and the trusted app catalog. Product SPAs keep their source in their own `apps/*` folders; Epicenter builds and serves their desktop variants without copying that source into this folder.

                                          |
                                          v
                              Bun loopback sidecar
                                          |
                                          v
                              apps/epicenter/src-tauri
```

A compiled application is a `dist/<id>` build this release declares, served
below `/apps/<id>/`. Whispering and Honeycrisp are the two. Each keeps its
independently deployable browser build, and the variant Epicenter serves is
selected at build time by the `epicenter-host` resolve condition.

That condition does not decide where the data lives. Every build opens its own
store, with no platform seam, and reaches one authority per signed-in account
(ADR-0226, ADR-0227). The host serves bundles and brokers credentials; it owns
no application data and constructs no database. What the condition still selects
is the credential path (`#platform/auth`, `#platform/instance`), because the
host really does broker a credential its windows cannot obtain.

## Run locally

Start Epicenter from the repository root:

```bash
bun dev:epicenter
```

### On Windows

`bun dev:epicenter` alone does not build here. The native crate pulls
transcribe-cpp with the `vulkan` feature on Windows x64, and that build needs
four things an ordinary shell does not provide: the MSVC environment, the Ninja
generator, a short target directory, and a CMake policy floor for the Opus that
`audiopus_sys` vendors. Each missing one is a hard failure, and the errors point
at vendored C++ rather than at what is actually wrong.

`apps/epicenter/scripts/windows-build-env.bat` supplies all four and then runs
the dev server. Run it from this directory:

```bat
scripts\windows-build-env.bat
```

It takes an optional command, so it also wraps anything else that has to compile
the crate:

```bat
scripts\windows-build-env.bat cargo build --manifest-path src-tauri\Cargo.toml
```

It finds Visual Studio through `vswhere`, so Build Tools, Community,
Professional and Enterprise all work, and it uses the Ninja that ships inside
that install. It picks a short `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at the root of the repository's
drive, because the ggml-vulkan shader build otherwise runs past Windows'
250-character object-path limit; set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` yourself to override
that, keeping it near a drive root. It needs `VULKAN_SDK` set, and warns when it
is not.

Epicenter opens Home, which is an application beside the others rather than a
shell above them (ADR-0209). Its Apps pane lists what this build can launch, the
compiled applications plus the selected catalog generation's members, and
launching one opens its own window; the OS is the switcher from there, and
closing Home leaves everything it launched running. Its Data pane is Epicenter's
own job: every workspace id as real read-only tables, where picking one makes
`SELECT * FROM notes` mean something and "Everything raw" shows the storage as it
is. Whispering hands transcription setup back to Home's Settings pane
when the host has no usable local model, and Settings offers the ordinary launch
action once there is one. The tray and deep links remain shortcuts into the same
windows:

```bash
open 'epicenter://app/whispering'
open 'epicenter://app/honeycrisp'
open 'epicenter://app/home'
```

## Publish an app catalog

The promotion command accepts already-built static outputs. It does not install
dependencies, run build scripts, or read application source (ADR-0179). How the
folders were produced, and by whom, is outside the contract. The candidate
directory contains one built result per app:

```text
candidate/
|-- notes/
|   `-- index.html
`-- timeline/
    `-- index.html
```

Publish it from the repository root:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/epicenter catalog:publish -- ./candidate --data-dir ./tmp/epicenter-data
```

Epicenter copies and validates the complete candidate, stores it as an
immutable generation, and atomically selects it for the next launch. A running
process keeps serving the generation it selected at startup. Restart Epicenter
to activate the new catalog.

## Build and verify

```bash
# Build Home, every compiled application, and the Bun sidecar
bun run --cwd apps/epicenter build:desktop

# Package the complete native application
bun run --cwd apps/epicenter desktop:build

# Typecheck Home plus every compiled application's platform conditions
bun run --cwd apps/epicenter typecheck

# Host, routing, sidecar, and window tests
bun test apps/epicenter/scripts apps/epicenter/src

# Native command and fixture tests
cargo test --manifest-path apps/epicenter/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

## Ownership rules

- `src-tauri` owns native commands, permissions, windows, deep links, and packaging.
- `src` owns the Bun host, trusted route catalog, static-asset containment, and Home session.
- `dist` is generated. Never edit it or commit product source beneath it.
- A product SPA owns its UI and browser deployment from its own app folder.
- A multi-host SPA selects implementations through build-time `#platform/*` conditions. Runtime checks guard optional capabilities; they do not choose which implementation was bundled.
- Do not create `apps/epicenter/<app>` source copies. The build must consume the canonical app source directly.

The durable host and trust decision is recorded in ADR-0118.

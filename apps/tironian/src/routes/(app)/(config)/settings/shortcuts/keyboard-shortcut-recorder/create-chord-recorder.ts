/**
 * The shared physical chord recorder: captures a gesture straight from the
 * webview's `keydown` stream in physical-key space (modifier flags plus a
 * physical `.code`), producing a `KeyBinding`. It can only see what the browser
 * exposes, so Fn and modifier-only holds are invisible here; that is fine, since
 * they are refused as global shortcuts anyway (ADR-0117). The global recorder
 * accepts a chord; the in-app recorder accepts whatever it yields.
 *
 * The completion model: each new key extends a 300ms window, and the gesture
 * commits when every key releases (immediate) or the window expires (the safety
 * net for the macOS quirk where a key's `keyup` is swallowed while a modifier is
 * still held). `onCapture` receives each captured `KeyBinding`; the recorder then
 * resets and keeps listening, so the owner can refuse a binding and let the user
 * try again without re-opening. The owner calls `stop()` once a capture is
 * accepted. Escape is left to bubble; the session owner cancels.
 *
 * `onProgress` fires on every keydown with the combo accumulated so
 * far, before the gesture completes. The recorder owns capture; the owner owns
 * meaning, so the owner reads this partial to preview the reach a binding would
 * earn ("hold a modifier and it reaches everywhere") live, as the user holds.

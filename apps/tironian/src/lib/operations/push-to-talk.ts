/**
 * Push-to-talk owns the recording it starts. A press starts a session; a release
 * (the plugin's `Released` edge) or the 5-minute cap stops only THAT recording,
 * by its id.
 *
 * Two correctness properties, both of which the bare "Released calls stop" model
 * lacked, and whose absence let a lost release edge leave recording stuck on:
 *
 * - Id-scoped: a press remembers the id of the recording it started, so a stray
 *   or duplicated release (or one that lands after that recording was supplanted
 *   by a toggle/button capture) never stops the wrong one.
 * - Startup-safe: a release that lands while the recording is still starting is
 *   latched (`stopRequested`) and honored the moment the recording exists, where
 *   checking the recorder state alone would miss it (it is not `RECORDING` yet).
 *
 * Push-to-talk is a physical hold, so presses are sequential; the generation id
 * still scopes every async continuation to its press, so a stale start completion
 * cannot arm a cap for a session already released.

/**
 * Project the main window's dictation lifecycle into the serializable status the
 * pill renders. A live capture is the pill's primary content; when capture is
 * idle (manual after stop, a VAD session after disarm) the outcome takes the
 * pill. `idle`/`none` hides the pill (`null`). The live error object is dropped
 * in favor of the failure `tier`, because the pill display must cross Tauri IPC on
 * desktop and the full failure detail lives on the recordings row and in the OS
 * notification.
 *
 * Shared by both dictation-indicator implementations so desktop and web project
 * identically: Tauri sends the result over IPC; the browser feeds it to the
 * shared pill directly.

/**
 * One recording as the app uses it: the row, with its audio id carrying the
 * brand the blob store requires.
 *
 * The workspace cannot express the brand. It declares `audioBlobId` as
 * `/^blob_[a-z0-9]{21}$/`, which is `BLOB_ID_ROUTE_REGEX` anchored: the exact
 * pattern `BlobId` validates and `generateBlobId` is locked to by a round-trip
 * test. What `RowOf` yields from it is the template literal type, which is the
 * same set of strings without the nominal marker.
 *
 * So this module restores a fact TypeScript lost rather than asserting a new
 * one, and it is the only place that does. Running `parseBlobId` here instead
 * would re-run the regex the store just ran on the way out of the projection,
 * and hand back an `undefined` no caller could act on: a stored value that did
 * not match would have failed conformance and arrived as a nonconforming
 * diagnostic, never as a row.

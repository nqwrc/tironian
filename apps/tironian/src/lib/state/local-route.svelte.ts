/**
 * Whether the host's local transcription route can run here, and what it accepts.
 *
 * Tironian has exactly one active local model per device; the host owns it and
 * Tironian Home administers it (ADR-0180). Tironian chooses the *route*
 * (local against a cloud provider) and reads this to render that choice
 * honestly. It never learns which model is active, what models exist, or
 * anything about what is cached or resident.
 *
 * Advisory, not a gate. Nothing here decides whether `transcribeRecording` may
 * be called: the host resolves the active model independently at the point of
 * use and fails closed on its own. That matters because the shared Hugging Face
 * cache changes outside Tironian, so a `ready` answer can be stale by the time
 * the user stops speaking. Treating this as a precondition would turn a stale
 * read into a refused transcription; treating it as advice turns it into a
 * slightly stale hint.
 *
 * Its real job is the *preventive* warning. When local transcription fails, the
 * surface that reports it is the dictation pill, which has nowhere to put a
 * recovery action, so the warning has to happen before the user speaks.
 *
 * Three states, and `checking` is genuinely separate from `unavailable`: a boot
 * that has not answered yet must not flash a warning, and a host that refused
 * must not read as ready. Refreshed on window focus, because the answer changes
 * in another window.

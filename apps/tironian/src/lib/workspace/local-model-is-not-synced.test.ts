/**
 * The active local transcription model must never synchronize (ADR-0180).
 *
 * It names model files and an accelerator that exist on one machine: a second
 * device may have neither the bytes nor compatible hardware, so a synced choice
 * would arrive as a model that cannot run. Tironian therefore owns the
 * transcription *route* here and nothing about which local model runs; the host
 * owns that, device-locally, and Tironian Home administers it.
 *
 * This guards the direction the mistake would come from. The workspace's `kv` section
 * IS the synced settings surface, so a local-model key landing in it is exactly
 * how the invariant would silently break: the key would look like an ordinary
 * setting and start replicating.

# Tironian Architecture Deep Dive

Tironian uses a clean three-layer architecture that shares one SPA between its browser deployment and the Tironian desktop host. This is possible because platform differences are selected at build time and business logic stays separate from UI concerns.

## Workspace Composition

Tironian binds its inert workspace definition through one environment-owned SQLite runtime, acquired as one ready app inside the mounted Svelte root:

```txt
defineData()                            src/lib/workspace/index.ts (inert schema)
  -> openTironianApp()           src/lib/app/app.ts (transactional async open)
    -> tironianDependencies             src/lib/app/dependencies.ts: the per-build dependencies
      -> openTironianUiSession()  src/lib/app/ui-session.ts (app + query runtime)
        -> (app)/+layout.svelte         raw {#await} owns pending / ready / failed
          -> TironianUiSessionProvider        typed context for ready-only descendants
```

`src/lib/workspace/index.ts` defines the fixed workspace id, row tables, and KV settings schema with `defineData`, with no platform APIs. `openTironianApp(dependencies, { signal })` opens the Tironian workspace through the runtime the environment supplies, hydrates settings, recordings, and recipes, and resolves only with those UI-free product namespaces ready; any failure releases everything it opened and rejects. The (app) layout wraps that open in one UI session (`openTironianUiSession`), which composes the Svelte reactivity adapters, a session-scoped TanStack `QueryClient`, and the query namespace over the ready app, and owns their ordered disposal. The layout creates the session promise during component initialisation, so the `{#await}` observes it from the first microtask. The fulfilled branch mounts `TironianUiSessionProvider`, which only publishes the ready session: typed `getTironianApp()` / `getTironianQueries()` context plus the session's query client. Boot retry is a full page reload; unmount/HMR aborts the acquisition, and the layout is the single owner of session disposal.

`tironianDependencies` is a pure per-build bindings object; its one platform-selected member is the blob capability (`#platform/blobs`): the browser build opens the one device workspace runtime directly; the desktop-hosted build uses the same-origin desktop workspace runtime, whose `open` performs an honest host acquisition handshake. There is no account runtime and no sync: every build opens the same device document. The app's recordings namespace owns row/blob consistency: local audio storage and deletion of the device copy and row as one workflow. Scalar rows live in runtime-native SQLite; row documents are lazy Yjs 14 documents behind the runtime's document provider (ADR-0144).

## Service Layer - Pure Business Logic + Platform Abstraction

The service layer contains all business logic as **pure functions** with zero UI dependencies. Services don't know about reactive Svelte variables, user settings, or UI state. They only accept explicit parameters and return `Result<T, E>` types for consistent error handling.

The key innovation is **build-time platform resolution** via Node-standard `#platform/*` subpath imports. Each platform-bound service lives in a folder with both implementations as sibling files plus a shared contract; the app's `package.json` `imports` map points each seam at the matching file per build condition:

```
src/lib/services/recorder/
  index.browser.ts    Browser MediaRecorder APIs
  index.tauri.ts      Tauri recorder plugin
  types.ts            Shared contract both impls are annotated with
```

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "imports": {
    "#platform/recorder": {
      "tauri": "./src/lib/services/recorder/index.tauri.ts",
      "default": "./src/lib/services/recorder/index.browser.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

The Tauri build activates the `tauri` condition; the web build falls through to `default` (browser):

```ts
// vite.config.ts
const isTironianHost = process.env.TIRONIAN_HOST === '1';
export default defineConfig(async () => ({
  resolve: {
    // The `...defaultClientConditions` spread is load-bearing: custom
    // conditions REPLACE Vite's defaults rather than adding to them.
    ...(isTironianHost && {
      conditions: ['tauri', ...defaultClientConditions],
    }),
  },
}));
```

Consumers (for example the services barrel `src/lib/services/index.ts`) import the bare specifier `from '#platform/recorder'` with **no platform branch at the call site**. Vite resolves `index.tauri.ts` on Tauri builds and `index.browser.ts` on web builds; the off-target file is never resolved, so it is physically absent from the bundle (a build-time guarantee, not Rollup tree-shaking). This makes the web bundle structurally unable to ship Tauri APIs and vice versa: a Tauri-only file imported by shared code fails the web build instead of shipping a broken runtime.

This mechanism is scoped to `#platform/*` only; every other bare import resolves normally. The browser typecheck uses the default condition, and `tsconfig.desktop.json` repeats the check with the `tironian-host` and `tauri` conditions the desktop build activates (ADR-0190). Each impl is annotated with the shared contract (`export const x: Contract = ...`, not `satisfies`, so the concrete type stays hidden and the variants stay in lockstep).

Tauri-only exports (Tironian's `tauriOnly` namespace in `src/lib/tauri.tauri.ts`) are imported **directly** by `.tauri.ts` files (`import { tauriOnly } from '$lib/tauri.tauri'`), not through a `#platform/*` seam, since that seam is null on web. Shared code that only needs the platform boolean reaches it through `import { tauri } from '#platform/tauri'` and checks `if (tauri)`.

Services are **testable** (just pass mock parameters), **reusable** (work identically anywhere via the shared contract in `types.ts`), and **maintainable** (no hidden runtime branches).

The codebase distinguishes two kinds of "which implementation" decisions and uses different mechanisms for each: a build-time platform switch (`#platform/*`, resolved by Vite before bundling) and a runtime capability switch (a plain `if` on a value like `tauri`, resolved once the bundle is running).

## Query Layer - Adding Reactivity and State Management

The query layer (`$lib/queries`) is where TanStack Query reactivity gets injected on top of the ready app and pure services. One `TironianUiSession` owns one `QueryClient` and one `TironianQueries` namespace; there is no module-global client. Components reach both through context:

```svelte
<script>
  import { createQuery } from '@tanstack/svelte-query';
  import { getTironianApp, getTironianQueries } from '$lib/app/context';

  const app = getTironianApp();
  const queries = getTironianQueries();

  // Domain data: workspace state (reactive, no queries needed)
  const latestRecording = $derived(app.recordings.sorted[0]);

  // Audio availability: still needs TanStack Query (blobs are too large for
  // workspace rows)
  const availability = createQuery(
    () => queries.audio.availability(() => latestRecording).options,
  );
</script>
```

**Workspace State** - The UI-free app owns domain data (recordings, recipes, settings). Thin `$lib/state/*.svelte.ts` adapters add `createSubscriber` tracking, so components react to the same namespaces that Bun scripts use.

The query layer's role has narrowed to things that don't fit in workspace rows:

- **External APIs**: Transcription mutations (`queries.transcription.*`) around the transcription operations
- **Microphone enumeration**: Async device list with loading states (`manualRecorder.enumerateDevices`). Recorder state itself lives in `$lib/state/manual-recorder.svelte.ts` and `$lib/state/vad-recorder.svelte.ts` as `$state`, not queries.
- **Audio blob access**: Too large for workspace rows, still served via the blob store (`queries.audio.availability`, `queries.download.downloadRecording`)

This design keeps services pure and platform-agnostic while giving the UI immediate reactivity for domain data and cached access for external resources.

## Error reporting

Services and operations return tagged errors built with `defineErrors` from `wellcrafted/error`. The call site decides what the user should see by calling `report.error`, `report.info`, `report.success`, or `report.loading` from `$lib/report`. The toast and OS notification surfaces are sinks the spine fans out to; the per-event copy is inline at the call site, not a translator function.

```typescript
const { data, error } = await services.recorder.startRecording(...);

if (error) {
  // Default: title is humanized from error.name, description is error.message,
  // a "More details" action opens the raw error.
  report.error({ cause: error });
  return;
}

// Inline override only when context-specific copy or an action helps:
if (error) {
  report.error({
    cause: error,
    title: 'Authentication required',
    action: { label: 'Update API key', onClick: () => goto('/settings') },
  });
  return;
}
```

## Error Handling with WellCrafted

Tironian uses [WellCrafted](https://github.com/wellcrafted-dev/wellcrafted), a lightweight TypeScript library I created to bring Rust-inspired error handling to JavaScript. I built WellCrafted after using the [effect-ts library](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) when it first came out in 2023. I was very excited about the concepts but found it too verbose. WellCrafted distills my takeaways from effect-ts and makes them better by leaning into more native JavaScript syntax, making it perfect for this use case. Unlike traditional try-catch blocks that hide errors, WellCrafted makes all potential failures explicit in function signatures using the `Result<T, E>` pattern.

`wellcrafted` ensures robust error handling across the entire codebase, from service layer functions to UI components, while maintaining excellent developer experience with TypeScript's control flow analysis.

## Architecture Patterns

- **Service Layer**: Platform-agnostic business logic with Result types
- **Query Layer**: Reactive data management with caching, scoped to one UI session (`queries.audio.*`, `queries.transcription.*`, `queries.download.*`)
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Pure Functions Over Classes**: Services are functions, not classes, making them easier to test and compose
2. **Explicit Error Handling**: Every function that can fail returns a Result type
3. **Platform Abstraction at Build Time**: Platform detection happens once, not at runtime
4. **Three Clear Layers**: Each layer has a specific responsibility with clear boundaries
5. **TypeScript Throughout**: Full type safety from services to UI components

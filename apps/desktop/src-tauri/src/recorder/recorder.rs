//! CPAL recorder built around a two-thread pipeline.
//!
//! ```text
//! cpal callback thread            writer worker thread
//! ┌──────────────────────┐  chan  ┌──────────────────────┐
//! │ build_input_stream   │ ─────▶ │ run_capture          │
//! │  - downmix to mono   │ bound  │  - hound WavWriter   │
//! │  - convert to PCM16  │   ed   │  - pad short clips   │
//! │  - try_send, or drop │        │  - emit mic level    │
//! └──────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! The cpal callback never blocks and never touches a file: it downmixes to
//! mono, converts to PCM16, and hands the chunk to a **bounded** channel with
//! `try_send`. A full channel drops the chunk, which is the only outcome that
//! keeps a stalled disk from stalling the audio thread.
//!
//! The worker writes those chunks straight into a staged WAV as they arrive, so
//! memory is flat in the recording's length rather than proportional to it. An
//! hour-long meeting costs the same resident audio as a four-second dictation:
//! one bounded queue and one `BufWriter`. That is the whole reason this path
//! exists, and it is why there is no separate long-form mode for an application
//! to select.
//!
//! # The staged file is at the device's rate, and that is private
//!
//! Capture writes mono PCM16 at whatever rate the microphone actually opened.
//! Nothing resamples during capture, because a streaming resampler in the write
//! path buys nothing: transcription already decodes arbitrary rates down to
//! 16 kHz, and cloud upload already resamples to 48 kHz for Opus. So the rate a
//! blob happens to be at is mechanism, not contract; no caller chooses it and no
//! caller reads it.
//!
//! # One recorder, owned by the window that started it
//!
//! There is exactly one recorder for the whole host, and at most one
//! recording in flight. A recording is addressed by the blob id the host
//! minted for it and is owned by the window label that started it. Every
//! lifecycle method takes both, so an application can only ever stop or
//! cancel the recording it actually started: a competing `start` is refused
//! with [`RecorderError::Busy`] rather than silently displacing the live one.
//!
//! # An ended recording is still the owner's to claim
//!
//! Capture can stop without anyone asking: the microphone is unplugged, a
//! permission is withdrawn, the stream dies. That releases the *device*, not the
//! *recording*. [`Recorder::end_capture`] marks the recording ended, drops the
//! cpal stream, and leaves everything else exactly where it was: the slot stays
//! occupied, the staged file stays on disk, and [`Recorder::current`] keeps
//! answering with the same recording plus the reason its capture ended.
//!
//! That is the whole interruption design. There is no pending-interruption
//! inbox, no acknowledgement, no restore call, and no second channel that pushes
//! audio at the owner. `stop` remains the one path that publishes a blob and
//! `cancel` remains the one path that deletes staging, whether or not capture is
//! still running when they are called. A competing `start` stays [`Busy`] until
//! the owner resolves it, or until the owning window is destroyed.
//!
//! [`Busy`]: RecorderError::Busy
//!
//! The label identifies a *window*, not an application: navigation across
//! `/apps/*` on the one loopback origin is permitted, so a window may change
//! which app it is showing. Under ADR-0179's full-trust model that is enough,
//! because ownership here exists for resource correctness, not isolation.
//! Labels are assigned by Rust (`BuiltInApp::id`) and cannot be supplied by the
//! frontend, which is what makes them usable at all.

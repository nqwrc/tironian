//! Native recorder staging and publication into Tironian's canonical local
//! blob layout.
//!
//! Rust mints the opaque `BlobId` when a recording starts, writes its audio and
//! metadata into a private staging directory, fsyncs both files, and atomically
//! renames the directory to `<appDataDir>/blobs/<BlobId>`. Raw PCM never crosses
//! the IPC boundary; an application holds only the id.
//!
//! The id exists before its blob does. `start` returns it, `stop` publishes the
//! blob under it, and `cancel` burns it without a blob ever appearing. That is
//! why this module mints and validates in the same place: the shape is one
//! contract shared with `packages/blobs`, and the two mints must agree.
//!
//! # Staging is not a blob
//!
//! A [`StagedBlob`] is a directory nothing outside this module can name. It is
//! written to while a recording runs and becomes a blob in exactly one step, the
//! rename in [`StagedBlob::publish`]. Until that rename there is no blob at the
//! id, which is what keeps ADR-0173's write-once slot from ever observing a
//! partial byte stream: incomplete capture has temporary staging state and no
//! permanent blob identity.

// `File` is read-only-open territory: the `cfg(unix)` `sync_directory` below and
// the tests' `File::create`. Windows non-test builds compile neither, so the
// import is gated to match or it warns as unused there.

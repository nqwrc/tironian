//! The recording command surface: the whole thing an application can reach.
//!
//! `start`, `stop`, `cancel`, `current`, and device enumeration. There is no
//! session to open or close, no lease object, and no handle: the host owns the
//! one recorder, and a recording is named by the blob id `start` returns.
//!
//! Every lifecycle command takes an injected `WebviewWindow`. Tauri supplies it
//! from the invoking window and specta renders it as nothing at all (its
//! `FunctionArg::to_datatype` returns `None`, `tauri/src/lib.rs:1130`), so the
//! caller's identity costs zero TypeScript surface and cannot be spoofed from
//! JS: window labels are assigned in Rust and the frontend never supplies one.
//!
//! Ownership here is resource correctness, not isolation. ADR-0179 grants an
//! admitted app broad same-origin and device authority on purpose; what these
//! rules prevent is one window destroying, stopping, or collecting the blob of
//! a recording another window started.

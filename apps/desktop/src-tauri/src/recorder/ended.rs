//! Why a recording ended without anyone asking it to.
//!
//! The capture stream can die under a live recording: the microphone is
//! unplugged, macOS revokes microphone access mid-dictation, the audio route
//! collapses. Before this existed, cpal's error callback only logged, so the
//! recorder kept its one slot occupied, the tray kept claiming a recording, and
//! the owning window waited forever for audio that would never arrive.
//!
//! What ends is the capture, not the recording. The reason below travels to the
//! owner so it can say something true about what happened; the audio captured up
//! to that moment stays claimable until the owner stops or cancels it.
//!
//! # The taxonomy is exactly as fine as cpal's evidence
//!
//! Every variant below is one the host can actually tell apart from a typed
//! `cpal::ErrorKind`, and each maps to a different thing the person can do.
//! Nothing here is inferred from a message string, and nothing distinguishes
//! two situations the host would have to guess between.
//!
//! # Not every stream error is terminal
//!
//! This is the part that is easy to get wrong. cpal reports routine, survivable
//! conditions through the same callback as fatal ones, and it documents which
//! is which. `DeviceChanged` explicitly says the stream stays active and needs
//! no rebuild, which is what happens when headphones are plugged in mid
//! sentence. `Xrun` is a glitched buffer. `RealtimeDenied` means audio keeps
//! flowing with worse scheduling. Ending a recording on any of those would
//! destroy a dictation over an event the user would otherwise never notice, so
//! [`classify`] returns `None` for them and the capture continues.

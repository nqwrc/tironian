//! The one Tironian application-data root, resolved natively.
//!
//! `@tironian/constants/app-data` is the authority on this path, and the Bun
//! sidecar calls it directly (ADR-0201). Rust resolves it here for the one
//! consumer that cannot be handed the sidecar's answer: the staged-recording
//! blob store in [`crate::recorder::blob`], which writes `<root>/blobs` from
//! Rust. Who eventually tells the recorder where blobs live is an open
//! question; until it is settled this is the second implementation of one path,
//! and the equality is pinned by a test rather than by inspection.
//!
//! Mirroring the authority means mirroring its *inputs*, not just its result on
//! one config. This resolves the platform directory and joins the shared
//! identifier constant, exactly as the TypeScript does; it deliberately does not
//! use Tauri's `app_data_dir()`, whose answer moves with the bundle identifier
//! and so split dev builds away from the sidecar (see
//! [`TIRONIAN_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`]).
//!
//! The override is part of that equality and not an extra. Rust used to compute
//! the root and pass it to the sidecar in `TIRONIAN_DATA_DIR`, which meant an
//! ambient value was overwritten and could not split the two. The sidecar now
//! resolves its own root and honours the variable, so the recorder has to honour
//! it too: otherwise a person who moved their data would have recordings written
//! to one `blobs/` and served from another.

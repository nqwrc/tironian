//! The local GGUF model catalog: the one Rust-owned source of truth for which
//! local models exist, their Hugging Face coordinate, their static capabilities,
//! and their download/cache status.
//!
//! A model is identified by a stable `modelId` string rendered from its Hugging
//! Face coordinate as `"{repo_id}@{revision}/{filename}"`. That id is an opaque
//! catalog key. Tironian Home names it when it administers models, and the host
//! stores the one active choice; applications never see it and never pass it to
//! `transcribe_recording` (ADR-0180). An id outside this catalog is refused
//! rather than parsed. (Custom drop-in GGUF is a later earned feature, not a
//! compatibility path.)
//!
//! Storage is the shared Hugging Face cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub`,
//! overridable by `HF_HOME`), owned by `hf-hub`: downloads stage, resume, and
//! integrity-check through it, and a file already in the cache (from this app or
//! any other HF tool) is reused. Rust never stores a path; it resolves the
//! coordinate to a cache path at point of use.

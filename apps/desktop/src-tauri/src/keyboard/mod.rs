//! The macOS Accessibility-grant watch for auto-paste-at-cursor.
//!
//! Global-shortcut input is `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` chords on every
//! platform (registered and dispatched by the Rust shell); this module owns no shortcut input
//! (ADR-0117). What survives is a macOS-only keyboard tap kept alive for one
//! reason: auto-paste-at-cursor writes a synthetic Cmd+V through the macOS
//! Accessibility grant, and a stale post-update grant reads as trusted through
//! `AXIsProcessTrusted` yet silently drops the paste. The only reliable way to
//! tell a healthy grant from a stale one is to run a real tap and watch whether
//! it stays alive; the supervisor does exactly that and publishes a
//! `DictationCapability` the paste path (`write_text`) gates on.
//!
//! Layering:
//! - `mac_tap`    the macOS tap (owned CGEventTap); it decodes nothing, it just
//!                lives so its death signals a stale grant
//! - `supervisor` the pure tap-lifecycle decision core (unit-tested)
//! - `event`      the `DictationCapability` value emitted to the FE
//!
//! Off macOS there is no grant to watch (paste needs no permission), so
//! `TapController` is a trivial stub: no tap, no supervisor, capability
//! `Unknown`, and `set_auto_paste_enabled` is a no-op.

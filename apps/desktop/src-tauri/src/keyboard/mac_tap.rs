//! macOS keyboard tap: the `listen` primitive for the supervisor on macOS,
//! owned in-tree instead of rented from `rdev::listen`.
//!
//! Why this exists. The rustdesk fork of rdev (`src/macos/listen.rs`) attaches
//! its CGEventTap source to `CFRunLoopGetMain()` and then calls
//! `CFRunLoopRun()`, which runs the *calling* thread's run loop. Tironian
//! spawns the listener on a background thread, where that thread's run loop has
//! no sources, so `CFRunLoopRun()` returns immediately, `listen()` returns
//! `Ok(())` instantly, and the supervisor misreads "registered" as "the tap
//! died" -> five restarts -> a false `Broken`. (rdev's own `grab.rs` uses
//! `CFRunLoopGetCurrent()` and is correct; only the `listen` path is wrong.)
//!
//! This module fixes that by construction, and closes two more gaps neither
//! rdev fork covers:
//! - it adds the tap source to **this** thread's run loop (`CFRunLoop::get_current`)
//!   and blocks here, so `listen` is a real blocking call the supervisor can
//!   trust;
//! - it **re-enables** a tap that macOS silently disabled under load
//!   (`kCGEventTapDisabledByTimeout` / `…ByUserInput`);
//! - it uses the safe `core-graphics` / `core-foundation` wrappers, whose RAII
//!   releases the mach port and run-loop source on return, so restarts do not
//!   leak onto the run loop the way the raw-FFI fork does.
//!
//! It runs purely for its liveness: the supervisor watches whether this tap
//! stays alive under a still-trusted grant to tell `Active` from `Broken` for
//! auto-paste-at-cursor (ADR-0117). The tap is passive (`ListenOnly`) and drops
//! every event; it no longer decodes keys or drives any matcher.

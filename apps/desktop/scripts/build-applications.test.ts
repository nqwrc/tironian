/**
 * Every declared compiled application actually builds, and is served below its

 *
 * This is the only check that runs each application's real Tironian build. It
 * goes through Tironian's own `build:<id>` script, so a declared application
 * with no working build script fails here rather than at a user's next launch,
 * and it reads the emitted document, so a build whose base path disagrees with
 * where the host serves it (`/apps/<id>/`) fails here rather than booting
 * blank.

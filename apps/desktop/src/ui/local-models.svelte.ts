/**
 * Home's local transcription model administration.
 *
 * Tironian has exactly one **active** local transcription model per device.
 * The host owns it; Home is the window that administers it (ADR-0180): which
 * model is active, downloading and deleting model files, and when the host
 * drops the resident model. Applications ask for transcription and never for a
 * model, so this store is the only place in the product where a model is chosen.
 *
 * Three kinds of truth, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *  - CATALOG, at rest: the models Rust offers, each carrying whether its file is
 *    already in the shared Hugging Face cache. Rust owns it (ADR-0022);
 *    refreshed on first use, on window focus, and after every mutation.
 *  - TRANSFERS, in motion: downloads underway, with progress and a cancel flag.
 *    Transient, fed by the download Channel; never in a catalog scan yet.
 *  - HOST SETTINGS, durable: the active model and the unload policy, owned by
 *    Rust and device-local, read back so this view reflects what the host will
 *    actually do rather than what it last asked for.
 *
 * Nothing here reports residency. Whether a model is loaded, warm, or evicted is
 * host-private; `installed` is disk presence and nothing more.
 *
 * Native-only. Home is also served to a plain browser and to a remote device,
 * where these commands do not exist and the model files are on another machine
 * anyway. Off Tauri the store stays inert and reports `available: false` rather
 * than throwing at import.

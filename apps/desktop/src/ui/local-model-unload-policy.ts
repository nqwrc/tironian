/**
 * When to drop the resident local transcription model from memory after the

 *
 * Presentation only. The values are the generated `UnloadPolicy` union, so this
 * list cannot name a policy Rust does not have, and Rust owns both the durable
 * value and the clock that enforces it (ADR-0012, ADR-0180). Adding a policy
 * starts in Rust; the type error here is the reminder to label it.
 *
 * Order is UX order (recommended first), not alphabetical.

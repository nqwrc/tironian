 * input) whenever {@link polishWillRun} is false.

 * `signal` lets the caller cancel the in-flight pass (the HUD's "ship raw"):
 * when it aborts, the raw input is returned as a clean success, not an error,
 * because shipping the raw transcript was the user's explicit intent.
 *
 * `override` replaces the global `polishInstructions` directive for this one
 * pass (a per-app rule's). It carries the directive and its standing together,
 * because the standing is not a separate fact to be looked up later: a rule
 * minted by a settings bundle holds words the person did not write, and reading
 * the words without their standing is what put them in the commanding slot.
 * Trusted or not, the fixed anti-injection scaffold wraps whichever directive
 * arrives, so it can never widen what Polish is allowed to do.
 *
 * Pure execution: no workspace writes, no toasts. The pipeline owns delivery and
 * keeps the raw transcript on `recordings.transcript` underneath the polished
 * text. On a genuine AI failure the raw input rides along in the error so
 * delivery can still proceed.

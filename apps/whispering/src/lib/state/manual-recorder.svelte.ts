/**
 * Creates the manual recorder with reactive state.
 *
 * State is owned by this module via Svelte's `$state` rune for synchronous
 * reactivity. Mirrors the shape of `vadRecorder` in `vad-recorder.svelte.ts`:
 *
 * - Reactive access: `manualRecorder.state` (triggers effects on change)
 * - Operations: `manualRecorder.startRecording()` etc.
 * - Device enumeration as a TanStack Query for loading states in selectors
 *
 * A recording is a `Recording` object returned by the implementation that
 * started it, and holding one is what "recording" means. `state` is derived
 * from that rather than mirrored beside it, so the two can never disagree and
 * there is no transition to miss.
 *
 * On Tauri the recorder is bootstrapped from `current()` before the first
 * lifecycle operation, because a host recording can outlive a JS reload. On web
 * `current()` always returns null after a reload.

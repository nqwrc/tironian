/**
 * The recorder switcher's row source: `readyTranscribers()`, a flat list of the
 * transcription routes usable *right now*, one per configured provider.
 *
 * Every route contributes exactly one row, on-device included. Choosing "Local"
 * picks a route; it does not pick a model, because the host owns the one active
 * local model and Epicenter Home administers it (ADR-0180). The local row names
 * no model at all: model identity is administration data this app never
 * receives, and a row that named one would be a picker growing back.
 *
 * The local row is present on desktop whether or not the host can currently run
 * it, so the selector can warn about it. Readiness is surfaced as a warning by
 * `getTranscriptionReadiness`, not by making the route disappear.
 *
 * Reactive by construction: the getters it reads (`settings`, `secrets`,
 * `deviceConfig`) are all reactive, so calling this inside a `$derived`
 * re-runs it when any source changes.

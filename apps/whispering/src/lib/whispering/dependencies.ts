 * The build's app dependencies. Pure data and factories: nothing here opens

 * `openWhisperingApp` inside the mounted Svelte root, where the raw `{#await}`
 * owns the acquisition from its first microtask.
 *
 * `defaultTranscriptionService` used to be here and is gone. It had one value,
 * and the application owns the initialization value (`transcriptionService = 'local'`), so
 * a second declaration of it was only somewhere for the two to disagree.

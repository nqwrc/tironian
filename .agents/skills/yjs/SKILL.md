# Yjs 14 CRDT Patterns
## Reference Repositories

- [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs): CRDT framework for shared editing and offline-first data
- [Yjs Protocols](https://github.com/yjs/y-protocols): algorithmic grounding for sync and awareness

## Upstream Grounding

When conflict semantics, transaction origins, shared-type behavior, update encoding, storage growth, or shared-type APIs affect correctness, use source-backed grounding before relying on memory. If DeepWiki MCP is available, ask a narrow question against `yjs/yjs`; for sync and awareness algorithms, ask against `yjs/y-protocols`. If DeepWiki is unavailable or the repo is not indexed, use upstream source or official docs directly. Treat DeepWiki as orientation, then verify decisive details against the locally pinned `@y/y` types and source before changing code.

Epicenter targets `@y/y` 14 only. Do not add `yjs` 13, `y-indexeddb`, a compatibility reader, a package alias, a dual wire, or a fallback. Existing Yjs 13 code is replacement material, not a compatibility surface.

Skip DeepWiki for stable basics and repo-local patterns already documented below.

Read [references/document-design.md](references/document-design.md) before
choosing how a new row document is structured. Counters, user-controlled
ordering, and nested shapes each have a conflict behavior that is expensive to
change once data exists.

Read [references/debugging.md](references/debugging.md) when a document
converges to unexpected state or grows faster than its content.

## Transactions, Origins, And Undo

- Yjs updates are commutative and idempotent. Custom sync and persistence layers should use state vectors instead of inventing ordering guarantees.
- Use `Y.encodeStateVector(doc)` to describe local clocks, then `Y.encodeStateAsUpdateV2(doc, remoteStateVector)` to send only missing updates.
- Persist and transmit bytes from the `updateV2` event. Replay them with `Y.applyUpdateV2(doc, update, origin)`.
- Wrap multi-write user actions in `doc.transact(() => { ... }, origin)`. This reduces observer churn and gives persistence, providers, and undo logic a useful origin.
- Treat transaction origins as the boundary for filtering provider echoes, app-authored operations, and undo tracking.
- Scope `Y.UndoManager` to concrete shared types. Set `trackedOrigins`, tune `captureTimeout`, and call `stopCapturing()` between logically separate commands.
- Use relative positions for collaborative cursor and selection anchors. Raw numeric indexes drift under remote edits.
- `Y.snapshot()` is a historical marker that depends on retained delete history. `Y.encodeStateAsUpdateV2(doc)` is the self-contained checkpoint format.
- Prefer separate top-level docs over Yjs subdocuments unless Epicenter owns the whole provider lifecycle for the subdoc path.

## Store Connection

- Yjs is network-agnostic. It supplies CRDT state, state vectors, updates, and awareness behavior, not Epicenter's connection topology, authorization, or durability contract.
- One socket per application, not one per open document. A replica connects to `STORE_SYNC_ROUTE.pattern` (`/api/store/v1/sync`, in `packages/sync/src/store-route.ts`) with a `namespace` naming the workspace and a `cursor` naming its own durably applied position, so a reconnect is a catch-up rather than a fresh start (ADR-0222).
- Whose data it is never appears in the query. It comes from the resolved bearer, server-side, so there is no value a client can put in the URL that reaches another partition (ADR-0092).
- Browser upgrades authenticate through exactly one `bearer.<token>` subprotocol entry, because a browser upgrade cannot set `Authorization`; the mount echoes only the main subprotocol on the 101, so the token never round-trips. Non-browser clients may use an `Authorization` header. Do not use cookie-only upgrades, query-string credentials, or post-accept authentication frames.
- The wire is framing and nothing else: `push`, `ack`, `refuse`, `entry`, `offer`, `snapshot`, `wanted` (`packages/data/src/sync/frames.ts`). No frame knows what an update means, what a row is, or what Yjs is, which is exactly why chunking is safe at that layer.
- Large updates are chunked at `CHUNK_BYTES`, set by Cloudflare's documented Durable Object SQLite value cap rather than by anything about Yjs. Do not raise it to the measured wall; the documented limit is the one Cloudflare is entitled to enforce.
- Presence is deliberately absent until a concrete consumer earns awareness state and disconnect cleanup. If added later, awareness is ephemeral and must never be persisted into the Y.Doc or the SQLite update log as canonical data.

## The Application Document And Independent Row Documents

The application's scalar rows live in one `Y.Doc` per application: roots are
`tables:<name>` and `kv`, a row is a nested `Y.Type` attribute on its table
root, and a field is an attribute on the row. Holding the attribute is what it
means to exist, and removing it is what deletion does. The nesting is not
stylistic: `Item.write` calls `findRootTypeKey`, a linear scan of `doc.share`,
so one root per row makes encoding quadratic in rows (5,417 ms for 20,000 rows
against 13 ms nested).

A row's rich content lives in its own independent top-level `Y.Doc` at the
row's derived address, `{databaseId}/{tableName}/{rowId}` (ADR-0248). The
document manager (`packages/data/src/store/documents.ts`) treats the address
as an opaque string: it opens fully hydrated handles, reuses one live `Y.Doc`
per address, persists locally authored `updateV2` bytes through the store's
one durable queue, and unloads a document when its last handle closes.

```typescript
// Scalar fields are attributes on the row, written through the table.
db.tables.notes.update(noteId, { title, pinned: true });
db.kv.update({ 'theme.mode': 'dark' });

// Prose never lives in a field. Each row owns an independent document,
// opened on demand and disposed when the surface holding it unmounts.
const { data: handle } = await db.tables.notes.openDocument(noteId);
const body = handle?.get('body', 'text'); // a Y.Type an editor binds to
handle?.[Symbol.dispose]();
```

Roots inside a row document are minted by name on first use, and that is safe
because a top-level root is addressed by its NAME: two devices first-opening
one note converge with both writes retained
(`packages/data/evidence/independent-document-roots.test.ts`). No root is
reserved at create time. Inside the APPLICATION document, only `Doc.get`
mints, and every key reaching it must be a table name the database declares:
reading an unknown row through `getAttr` costs nothing, while a misspelled
table name costs a permanent root.

Row deletion is one composition point: `table.delete(rowId)` removes the
scalar row and durably tombstones the derived address in one atomic batch, so
a late update cannot resurrect a retired document. Lists and previews read
scalar fields only and never hydrate rich documents.

## Owner-Side Persistence

Every document's update chain persists in the store's one durable record:
`_updates (document, seq, bytes)` in SQLite, `[document, seq]` keys in the
browser's IndexedDB, with retired addresses in `_tombstones` and unsent work
in a per-document `_outbox` (ADR-0238, ADR-0248). Do not add a separate
IndexedDB provider or a second document store.

- Attach the `updateV2` listener before hydration. Replay stored updates with a private hydration origin so loading cannot append the same bytes again.
- A locally authored append joins the durable queue with an outbox id on a replica. Authority-accepted bytes use a remote origin and create no outbound obligation.
- Each document's chain folds at `SNAPSHOT_FOLD_THRESHOLD` by replaying into a fresh `gc: true` document and rewriting the chain as one complete V2 state update.
- Treat replay corruption as storage failure: a document that cannot hydrate refuses its open rather than handing out a half-hydrated handle.

## Storage Optimization

Use raw `Y.Map` for bounded, rarely changing structures inside a document root.
`Y.Map` tombstones retain the key forever, and every `ymap.set(key, value)`
creates a new internal item and tombstones the previous one, which is why
`gc: true` is what collapses a field edited 5,000 times down to two structs.

## Working with Raw Y.js Types Outside Their Owning Module

Y.js shared types (`Y.Map`, `Y.Text`, `Y.XmlFragment`, `Y.Array`) are implementation details that should stay behind typed APIs. When consumer code reaches through an abstraction to manipulate raw shared types, it creates coupling that's hard to change later.

**The pattern**: If a module returns Y.js shared types for editor binding (e.g., `handle.asText()` returns `Y.Text`), that's intentional: the consumer needs the live CRDT reference. But if consumer code is *constructing*, *casting*, or *mutating* Y.js types that the owning module should encapsulate, that's a leak.

```typescript
// BAD: consumer reaches through handle to do raw Y.Text mutation
const entry = handle.currentEntry;
if (entry?.type === 'text') {
    handle.batch(() => entry.content.insert(entry.content.length, text));
}

// GOOD: timeline owns the append operation
handle.append(text);
```

```typescript
// BAD: consumer constructs Y.Maps to call an internal CSV helper
import { parseSheetFromCsv } from './internal/sheet.js';
const columns = new Y.Map<Y.Map<string>>();
const rows = new Y.Map<Y.Map<string>>();
parseSheetFromCsv(csv, columns, rows);

// GOOD: use the handle's write method, which encapsulates CSV parsing
handle.write(csv);  // mode-aware, handles sheet internally
```

### How to Spot Abstraction Leaks

These are code smell indicators that Y.js internals are leaking:

- **Type assertions**: `as Y.Map`, `as Y.Text`, `as Y.XmlFragment` outside the owning module means someone is working with untyped data and forcing it into shape. The typed API is incomplete.
- **Mode branching**: `if (entry.type === 'text') ... else if (entry.type === 'sheet')` in consumer code means the consumer knows about internal content modes that the abstraction should handle.
- **Raw mutations in batch callbacks**: `handle.batch(() => ytext.insert(...))` means the consumer is doing CRDT operations that should be a method on the handle.
- **Internal helper re-exports**: Functions that take `Y.Map<Y.Map<string>>` parameters on a public API force consumers to have raw Y.js references to call them.
- **`ydoc.getArray()`/`ydoc.getMap()` outside infrastructure**: Consumer code accessing the raw Y.Doc to read/write data bypasses the table/kv/timeline APIs.

### The Boundary Rule

Three layers, each with clear Y.js exposure:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Consumer Code (apps, features)                      │
│  • Uses row document handles and typed root APIs     │
│  • MAY bind to Y.Text/Y.XmlFragment from as*()      │
│  • NEVER constructs Y.js types                       │
│  • NEVER casts to Y.js types                         │
│  • NEVER calls .insert()/.delete() on raw types      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Format Bridges (markdown, sheet converters)          │
│  • Accepts Y.js types as parameters (they're bridges)│
│  • Converts between Y.js ↔ string/JSON               │
│  • Lives close to the owning module                   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Row Document Internals                               │
│  • Constructs and manages Y.js shared types           │
│  • Owns the Y.Doc layout (array keys, map structure)  │
│  • Exposes typed APIs that hide the CRDT details      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When reviewing code, ask: "Could this consumer do its job with only the typed API?" If yes and it's using raw Y.js types instead, that's a leak worth fixing.

# Svelte Lifecycle And Reactivity Patterns

Detailed Svelte 5 guidance for keyed resources, async gates, shallow aliases, finite union mapping, SvelteMap, reactive table state, and state modules.

# Prop-Keyed Resources: Let the Tree Own the Lifecycle

When a component owns a disposable resource (subscription, socket, timer, any handle with a `dispose()`/`close()`/`unsubscribe()` method) whose identity depends on a prop, open it synchronously and let the parent control mount/unmount with `{#key}` or `{#if}`. Don't store the resource in nullable `$state` and re-open it inside an `$effect`: that reimplements component mount/unmount in user-space.

## The rule

```svelte
<!-- Parent: one lifecycle boundary, structurally visible -->
{#if resourceId}
	{#key resourceId}
		<ResourceView id={resourceId} />
	{/key}
{/if}

<!-- Child: id is stable for this instance; open sync, dispose on unmount -->
<script lang="ts">
	let { id }: { id: string } = $props();

	const resource = openResource(id);
	$effect(() => () => resource.dispose());
</script>

<SomeView data={resource.data} />
```

The child's handle is non-nullable. No `{#if handle}` guard leaks into markup. The effect has one line because its only job is cleanup.

## The anti-pattern

```svelte
<!-- Reimplements mount/unmount by hand -->
<script lang="ts">
	let { id }: { id: string } = $props();
	let handle = $state<Resource | null>(null);

	$effect(() => {
		const h = openResource(id);
		handle = h;
		return () => { h.dispose(); handle = null; };
	});
</script>

{#if handle}
	<SomeView data={handle.data} />
{/if}
```

It's easy to write a double-dispose or leak here. The version above can't: the body is the cleanup.

## Decision check

1. Is the id a prop? -> Parent keys on it with `{#key}`; child opens sync.
2. Can the id be absent? -> Parent wraps in `{#if id}<Child {id} />{/if}`; child opens sync.
3. Does the component have local UI state (selection, zoom, scroll) that must survive an id swap without persistence? -> rare exception; the nullable-state pattern is justified.

## Async-gate variant

When the resource exposes a readiness promise (`whenReady`, `whenLoaded`), gate rendering in the **template** with `{#await}`. Do NOT introduce a `$state(false)` flag + `$effect` that flips it inside `.then()`: Svelte already owns promise lifecycles, cancellation, and error branching. Rebuilding that in userland is pure ceremony.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	const resource = openResource(id);
	$effect(() => () => resource.dispose());
</script>

{#await resource.whenReady}
	<div class="flex h-full items-center justify-center">
		<Spinner class="size-5 text-muted-foreground" />
	</div>
{:then _}
	<Editor binding={resource.body.binding} />
{:catch error}
	<ErrorState {error} />
{/await}
```

Bare `{:then}` is valid Svelte when the resolved promise value is unused. In this repo, use `{:then _}` for readiness gates because Biome 2.4.x currently parses bare `{:then}` as `Expected an expression, instead none was found`. Treat `_` as a temporary compatibility placeholder, not a semantic value. Use `{:then value}` only when the resolved value is actually read.

### Anti-pattern: don't do this

```svelte
<!-- Bad: Re-implements {#await} with extra state and a cancellation flag -->
<script lang="ts">
	let isLoaded = $state(false);
	$effect(() => {
		let cancelled = false;
		resource.whenReady.then(() => { if (!cancelled) isLoaded = true; });
		return () => { cancelled = true; };
	});
</script>

{#if isLoaded}<Editor />{:else}<Spinner />{/if}
```

Three problems, every time:
1. **One idea, three primitives.** A state var, a subscription effect, and an if/else branch collectively say what `{#await}` says in four lines.
2. **Silent unhandled rejections.** The `.then()` chain drops errors on the floor. `{#await}`'s `{:catch}` makes failure explicit and catchable.
3. **Manual stale-result handling.** The `cancelled` flag exists because `.then()` can fire after the branch is gone. `{#await}` keeps the pending, fulfilled, and rejected render states tied to the template branch instead of scattering that state across a flag and an effect.

### When you still need `$state` flags

`{#await}` is for **one stable promise** driving one render branch. Reach for `$state` + `$effect` only when:
- You're composing multiple promises with custom logic (race, timeout, retry).
- The flag reflects an external reactive source (`$derived(query.isPending)` from TanStack Query, a Svelte store, `createSubscriber`).

## `$state.raw` for non-proxyable handles

Svelte's deep proxy can break handles whose methods rely on `this` being the original instance, or that hold internal non-reactive state. Prefer keeping handles out of `$state` entirely (the rule above). If a handle must live in state, use `$state.raw(handle)` to skip proxying.

## Project-specific application

In this codebase, the rule applies to any component calling `*Docs.open()` (Yjs doc handles from `createDisposableCache`). Search: `$state<ReturnType<typeof .*\.open>`. Every hit is a candidate for the rule above.

## Imperative Widgets: Own The Whole Runtime Boundary

For imperative widgets such as ProseMirror, CodeMirror, maps, charts, or
canvas-based tools, prefer one component that owns the whole runtime boundary:

```txt
keyed id prop
  -> open disposable resource
  -> wait for readiness in markup
  -> construct imperative widget once
  -> destroy widget and resource on component teardown
```

Avoid splitting this into a resource component plus a one-call generic widget
component that only receives a stable handle such as `Y.XmlFragment`,
`HTMLElement`, `EditorState`, `Map`, or `Chart` config. That split usually
creates a reactive prop boundary around a value that is not application state.

Use `untrack` in a widget setup effect only for values that are intentionally
not part of widget identity, such as a stable notification callback. If you need
`untrack` for the main setup object, first ask whether the component owns the
wrong boundary. Moving ownership to the keyed child often removes the need for
`untrack` and makes the lifecycle visible in the tree.

Keep a generic widget component only when there are several real callers, a
public component API, or a non-obvious widget invariant that deserves its own
file. Otherwise, collapse the wrapper into the component that owns the resource
and mount lifetime.

# Shallow Template Aliases: Inline Direct Reads

Svelte template expressions already track reactive property reads. Do not add a `$derived` or `{@const}` whose only job is to rename a shallow property read for markup.

```svelte
<!-- Bad: the alias does not compute anything -->
<script lang="ts">
	const current = $derived(session.current);
</script>

{#if current}
	<AccountPopover principal={current.principal} />
{/if}
```

```svelte
<!-- Good: read the source directly in markup -->
{#if session.current}
	<AccountPopover principal={session.current.principal} />
{/if}
```

The same rule applies to block-local `{@const}` passthroughs:

```svelte
<!-- Bad -->
{#await session.whenReady}
	<Loading />
{:then _}
	{@const current = session.current}
	{#if current}
		<SignedInApp principal={current.principal} />
	{/if}
{/await}
```

```svelte
<!-- Good -->
{#await session.whenReady}
	<Loading />
{:then _}
	{#if session.current}
		<SignedInApp principal={session.current.principal} />
	{/if}
{/await}
```

Keep the alias when it owns real work:

- Computed predicates or values: `const isSelected = $derived(selectedId === item.id)`.
- Values used by script logic, effects, or other derived values.
- Expensive or noisy computations that should run once per block.
- Dynamic component binding: `{@const Icon = item.icon}` before `<Icon />`.
- Discriminated union payloads inside an `{#each}` branch when the alias improves narrowing and readability: `{@const bookmark = item.bookmark}`.

Searches:

```bash
rg -n '\$derived\([^)]*\.[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*\)' --glob '*.svelte'
rg -n '\{@const\s+[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*\s*=\s*[^}\n]+\.[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*\s*\}' --glob '*.svelte'
```

# `$derived` Value Mapping: Use `satisfies Record`, Not Ternaries

When a `$derived` expression maps a finite union to output values, use a `satisfies Record` lookup. Never use nested ternaries. Never use `$derived.by()` with a switch just to map values.

```svelte
<!-- Bad: nested ternary in $derived -->
<script lang="ts">
	const tooltip = $derived(
		syncStatus.current === 'connected'
			? 'Connected'
			: syncStatus.current === 'connecting'
				? 'Connecting...'
				: 'Offline',
	);
</script>

<!-- Bad: $derived.by with switch for a pure value lookup -->
<script lang="ts">
	const tooltip = $derived.by(() => {
		switch (syncStatus.current) {
			case 'connected': return 'Connected';
			case 'connecting': return 'Connecting...';
			case 'offline': return 'Offline';
		}
	});
</script>

<!-- Good: $derived with satisfies Record -->
<script lang="ts">
	import type { SyncStatus } from './types';

	const tooltip = $derived(
		({
			connected: 'Connected',
			connecting: 'Connecting...',
			offline: 'Offline',
		} satisfies Record<SyncStatus, string>)[syncStatus.current],
	);
</script>
```

Why `satisfies Record` wins:

- Compile-time exhaustiveness: add a value to the union and TypeScript errors on the missing key. Nested ternaries silently fall through.
- It's a data declaration, not control flow. The mapping is immediately visible.
- `$derived()` stays a single expression: no need for `$derived.by()`.

Reserve `$derived.by()` for multi-statement logic where you genuinely need a function body. For value lookups, keep it as `$derived()` with a record.

`as const` is unnecessary when using `satisfies`. `satisfies Record<T, string>` already validates shape and value types.

See `docs/articles/record-lookup-over-nested-ternaries.md` for rationale.

# When to Use SvelteMap vs $state

Use `SvelteMap` when items have stable IDs and you need keyed lookup. Reads of
`get`, `has`, `size`, and iteration participate in Svelte reactivity when they
happen inside a template, `$derived`, or `$effect`. Use `$state` for primitives,
local UI booleans, and sequential data without identity.

`SvelteMap` does not deep-proxy its values. If nested fields must update
reactively, store row objects that are already reactive, or replace the map
value with `set(id, next)`.

| Data Shape | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Tironian store table rows | `fromData` reactive tables | recordings, recipes |
| Browser API keyed data | `new SvelteMap()` + listeners | media devices, windows |
| Primitive value | `$state(value)` | `$state(false)`, `$state('')`, `$state(0)` |
| Replace-only sequential data without IDs | `$state.raw<T[]>([])` | terminal history, command history |
| Replace-only ordered list where position matters | `$state.raw<T[]>([])` | open file tab order |

For an id-keyed collection you own and mutate in place, `SvelteMap` still beats
`$state<T[]>`: `.find()` scans, a whole-array write re-triggers every reader, and
sorting inside a getter returns a fresh array on every access, which sends
TanStack Table into an infinite loop. See
`docs/articles/sveltemap-over-state-for-keyed-collections.md`.

# Reactive Table State Pattern

Store reads are synchronous and return plain JSON, so the source of truth is a
re-read, not a long-lived reactive collection. `fromData` from
`@tironian/svelte` packages that re-read once: it mirrors an opened data
document's declared `tables`/`kv` and makes every read verb reactive
(`rows`, `nonconforming`, `list`, `get`, `ids`, `document`), while `create`,
`update`, and `delete` pass through unchanged. The invalidation it rides fires
after the projection commits (ADR-0221) for a local write, for prose typed
into a row's document, and for bytes that arrived from another device alike.

```typescript
// Root of the surface: adapt the chosen document once, then layer app state.
const store = fromData(data);
const table = store.tables.recordings;

// Derived views: filtering and sorting are cached here, not in the getter.
const all = $derived(table.rows.filter((recording) => recording.deletedAt === null));

return {
	get all() {
		return all;
	},
	get(id: RecordingId) {
		return table.rows.find((recording) => recording.id === id);
	},
};
```

There is no `refresh`, no generation counter, no `await` on a read, and no
`Symbol.dispose`: the adapter's subscriptions are ref-counted to the effects
that read them, so they detach when the consuming components unmount, and a
declared table nothing reads never subscribes at all. A read inside
`$derived` or a template tracks; a read in an event handler is fresh and
untracked. Do not hand-roll `db.<table>.subscribe(listener)` feeding
`$state.raw` for table reads; that pattern is what the adapter replaced.

Adapter: `packages/svelte-utils/src/from-data.svelte.ts`.

See the `typescript` skill for iterator helpers (`.toArray()`, `.filter()`, `.find()` on `IteratorObject`).

### Template Props

For component props expecting `T[]`, derive in the script block: never materialize in the template:

```svelte
<!-- Bad: re-creates array on every render -->
<FujiSidebar entries={entries.values().toArray()} />

<!-- Good: cached via $derived -->
<script>
	const entriesArray = $derived(entries.values().toArray());
</script>
<FujiSidebar entries={entriesArray} />
```

### Why `$derived`, Not a Plain Getter

Put reactive computations in `$derived`, not inside public getters.

A getter may still be reactive if it reads reactive state, but it recomputes on every access. `$derived` computes reactively and caches until dependencies change.

Use `$derived` for the computation. Use the getter only as a pass-through to expose that derived value.

See `docs/articles/derived-vs-getter-caching-matters.md` for rationale.

# Reactive State Module Conventions

State modules use a factory function that returns a flat object with getters and methods, exported as a singleton.

```typescript
function createBookmarkState(db: AppData) {
	let rows = $state.raw<Bookmark[]>([]);
	function read() {
		const { data, error } = db.bookmarks.list();
		if (error !== null) return reportBackgroundError(error);
		rows = data.rows;
	}
	read();
	const stop = db.bookmarks.subscribe(read);

	const bookmarks = $derived(rows.filter((b) => b.deletedAt === null));

	return {
		[Symbol.dispose]: stop,
		get bookmarks() { return bookmarks; },
		add(fields: BookmarkFields) { /* ... */ },
		remove(id: BookmarkId) { /* ... */ },
	};
}

export const bookmarkState = createBookmarkState(db);
```

## Naming

| Concern | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Export name** | `xState` for domain state; descriptive noun for utilities | `bookmarkState`, `notesState`, `deviceConfig`, `vadRecorder` |
| **Factory function** | `createX()` matching the export name | `createBookmarkState()` |
| **File name** | Domain name, optionally with `-state` suffix | `bookmark-state.svelte.ts`, `auth.svelte.ts` |

Use the `State` suffix when the export name would collide with a key property (`bookmarkState.bookmarks`, not `bookmarks.bookmarks`).

## Accessor Patterns

| Data Shape | Accessor | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Collection** | Named getter | `bookmarkState.bookmarks`, `notesState.notes` |
| **Single reactive value** | `.current` (Svelte 5 convention) | `selectedFolderId.current`, `serverUrl.current` |
| **Keyed lookup** | `.get(key)` | `toolTrustState.get(name)`, `deviceConfig.get(key)` |

The `.current` convention comes from [runed](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed) (the standard Svelte 5 utility library). All 34+ runed utilities use `.current`. Never use `.value` (Vue convention).

## Persisted State Utilities

For localStorage/sessionStorage persistence, use `createPersistedState` (single value) or `createPersistedMap` (typed multi-key config) from `@tironian/svelte`.

```typescript
// Single value: .current accessor
import { createPersistedState } from '@tironian/svelte';
const theme = createPersistedState({
	key: 'app-theme',
	schema: type("'light' | 'dark'"),
	defaultValue: 'dark',
});
theme.current; // read
theme.current = 'light'; // write + persist

// Multi-key config: .get()/.set() with SvelteMap (per-key reactivity)
import { createPersistedMap, defineEntry } from '@tironian/svelte';
const config = createPersistedMap({
	prefix: 'myapp.config.',
	definitions: {
		'theme': defineEntry(type("'light' | 'dark'"), 'dark'),
		'fontSize': defineEntry(type('number'), 14),
	},
});
config.get('theme'); // typed read
config.set('theme', 'light'); // typed write + persist
```

Both accept `storage?: Storage` (defaults to `window.localStorage`) for dependency injection.

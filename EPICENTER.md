## The Store

The hard problem with local-first apps is synchronization. If each device has
its own SQLite file, how do you keep them in sync?

Epicenter's answer: **an application has one scalar Yjs document, replayed in
full before any handle exists, and the surface over it is synchronous.** A read
is a property access, not a round trip, so nothing is awaited and nothing needs
cache invalidation or race protection. Rich row content lives in independently
loaded row documents.

```typescript
import { openDevice } from '@epicenter/data/browser';
import { defineData, field } from '@epicenter/data/definition';

const notesDefinition = defineData({
	id: 'com.example.notes',
	kv: {},
	tables: {
		notes: {
			title: field.string(),
			pinned: field.boolean(),
			folderId: field.nullable(field.string()),
		},
	},
});

// Every verb returns a Result; the error arm is elided here for length.
const { data } = await openDevice(notesDefinition);  // the only await

const note = data.tables.notes.create({ title: 'Hello', pinned: false, folderId: null });

const listed = data.tables.notes.list();          // synchronous: { rows, nonconforming }
const stop = data.tables.notes.subscribe(read);   // fires with the row ids a commit touched
```

A *data definition* is one application's declaration of its durable data: pure
JSON field descriptors, no storage and no lifecycle of its own. It is
release-local and never migrates your data. A row it cannot read is reported
beside the rows it can, with the reason and the raw values intact, and an
ordinary write repairs it.

Prose merges per character in an independent row document: open it with
`await data.tables.notes.openDocument(note.id)`, then bind a named root such as
`body` to the editor. Epicenter never looks inside the row document. The scalar
application document's exact `app`/`kv`/`tables:<name>` shape is recorded in
[ADR-0257](docs/adr/0257-the-application-document-has-named-kv-and-table-roots.md).

Sync is one Cloudflare Durable Object per (account, application). Being signed
in on two devices is the entire sharing model: nothing is paired, invited, or
approved.

## Build With The Toolkit

The developer toolkit is MIT: build anything on it, including closed-source and commercial products, and you own what you build, with no obligation back to Epicenter. [`@epicenter/data`](packages/data) and [`@epicenter/ui`](packages/ui) are the packages meant to leave this repo. They are pre-1.0 and tuned for our own apps, so treat them as fork-and-own rather than a stability-guaranteed SDK for now.

## Status

There is one runtime: a desktop SPA in a WebView, over a store the client owns.
A host serves bundles and brokers credentials; it owns no application data. A
hosted web runtime with a host-owned replica is refused, and so are third-party
installed apps, for now.

[Honeycrisp](apps/honeycrisp) is the app running on the store, and its
README is the worked example.

Whispering, vocab, skills, and the Epicenter host do not compile right now. The
superseded data stack was deleted before they were migrated, deliberately: the
new store has no row-document HTTP path and no multi-process observation
carrier, so there was nowhere for them to move until those refusals landed. Data
they held on the old stack is accepted as lost; there is no importer.

[Matter](apps/matter) edits user-owned Markdown folders directly and keeps a
disposable `matter.sqlite` query mirror beside them. [Local
Books](apps/local-books) and [Local Mail](apps/local-mail) are headless mirrors
that pull a hosted account into local SQLite. Those three do not use the store.

## Trust Boundaries

Pick the trust model you want.

| Path | What leaves your device |
| --- | --- |
| Signed out | Nothing. The store is complete on the machine it opened on, and every read comes from a document already in memory. |
| Signed in | Your application's document, as opaque update bytes, to one authority per account. |
| Hosted Epicenter | That authority is ours, along with account and session data and any hosted feature you enable. |
| Self-hosted instance | You control the server, secrets, deployment, and infrastructure boundary. |
| A provider an app calls | Whatever that app sends it: transcript text to an LLM, audio to a transcription provider. Epicenter servers are not in that path. |

Signed-in sync sends your data to a trusted server that reads it in plaintext. On hosted Epicenter the authority is ours, so that data sits inside our trust boundary; self-hosting puts it on infrastructure you control, so Epicenter never holds it. See the [trust model](docs/trust-model.md) for the details, including where this is heading with the anchor.

## Repo Map

### Apps

| App | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Honeycrisp](apps/honeycrisp) | Runs on the store | Local-first notes. Folders and notes are rows; a note's prose is a rich-text type inside its row. |
| [Matter](apps/matter) | Runs, separately | Typed grid over user-owned Markdown folders. It edits ordinary `.md` files directly; `matter.sqlite` is a disposable query mirror. |
| [Local Books](apps/local-books), [Local Mail](apps/local-mail) | Run, separately | Headless CLI mirrors that pull QuickBooks and Gmail into local SQLite. |
| [API](apps/api) | Hosted infrastructure | Personal cloud Worker. Owns the store authority binding, hosted-only billing, and the dashboard. |
| [Self-host](apps/self-host) | Reference deployable | Community-supported single-partition instance without hosted billing. |
| [Whispering](apps/whispering), [vocab](apps/vocab), [skills](apps/skills), [Epicenter](apps/epicenter) | Do not compile | Awaiting migration onto the store. See [Status](#status). |
| Other app folders | Research and prototypes | Useful history and experiments, not the current product lineup. |

### Packages

These packages carry the main architecture.

| Package | Role | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@epicenter/data`](packages/data) | The store: one Yjs document per application, a synchronous surface over it, and the transport that carries it. | MIT |
| [`@epicenter/data/definition`](packages/data/src/definition) | The inert data-definition vocabulary: JSON field descriptors, row addresses, and nonconformance. | MIT |
| [`@epicenter/sqlite`](packages/sqlite) | Neutral embedded-SQLite driver with Browser, Bun, and Durable Object adapters. It owns no product schema. | MIT |
| [`@epicenter/sync`](packages/sync) | The WebSocket subprotocol vocabulary both halves of a handshake must agree on. | MIT |
| [`@epicenter/ui`](packages/ui) | Shared Svelte component library used by multiple apps. | MIT |
| [`@epicenter/server`](packages/server) | Shared Hono server library composed by the hosted API and the self-host reference deployable. | AGPL-3.0-or-later |

## Architecture

The server side is split into one shared library and two deployable folders:

```txt
packages/server
  shared Hono library
  route composition for auth, sessions, store sync, blobs,
  and provider-backed inference and transcription

apps/api
  hosted personal Cloudflare Worker
  composes packages/server with a Better Auth principal resolver
  owns hosted-only dashboard and billing code

apps/self-host
  self-hosted single-partition instance reference deployable
  composes packages/server with the instance principal resolver
  community-supported
  no hosted billing surface
```

[Full architecture walkthrough](docs/architecture.md) | [Trust model](docs/trust-model.md)

## Development

Use Bun in this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter.git
cd epicenter
bun install
```

Every app starts from the repo root. `bun dev:<app>` runs every process the app needs; for apps that talk to the hosted API, that includes the API worker on `localhost:8787`. `bun dev:<app>:ui` runs the app's frontend alone when that split exists, and `bun dev:api` runs just the backend. Bare `bun dev` is `bun dev:honeycrisp`, and `bun run` with no arguments lists every target.

| Command | Starts | App port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bun dev:honeycrisp` | API + Honeycrisp desktop | 5175 |
| `bun dev:honeycrisp:ui` | Honeycrisp in the browser, no API or Tauri shell | 5175 |
| `bun dev:api` | Hosted API worker alone | 8787 |
| `bun dev:api-dashboard` | API + dashboard UI | 5178 |
| `bun dev:landing` | Landing site, standalone | 4321 |
| `bun dev:matter` | Matter desktop, standalone | 5180 |
| `bun dev:posthog-reverse-proxy` | PostHog reverse proxy Worker | wrangler default |
| `bun dev:self-host` | Self-host server (needs `INSTANCE_TOKEN`) | 8787 |

`bun dev:whispering`, `bun dev:vocab`, `bun dev:skills`, and `bun dev:epicenter` still exist, but those apps do not compile until they are migrated onto the store.

The API needs local Postgres and Infisical; see [apps/api/README.md](apps/api/README.md). Rust is needed for Tauri apps such as Honeycrisp and Matter. Local Books and Local Mail run their own multi-process dev flows; their READMEs document them.

`bun run check` is the gate. It runs lint, typecheck, every workspace test, and the structural checks, and it is the same gate CI runs, so a green local run predicts a green pull request. Formatting is handled separately by the autofix workflow.

```bash
bun run check
```

Run the pieces on their own while you work:

```bash
bun run format          # rewrite formatting (CI autofixes this for you)
bun run lint:check
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run check:structure # doc paths, catalog pins, API paths, licenses, UI boundary, boot purity
```

Two checks sit outside the gate on purpose. `bun run check:doc-hygiene` flags specs and ADRs that time has made stale, so it belongs to review rather than to merge. `bun run smoke:local` boots the API against local services.

## Design Notes

Durable decisions and their reasoning live in [docs/adr/](docs/adr). Specs in [specs/](specs) are in-flight design scaffolding rather than current truth; when a spec and an ADR disagree, the ADR wins. Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Good entry points are docs, local-first infrastructure, Svelte interfaces, migrating a broken app onto the store, and small changes that make the repo easier to understand.

## License

Epicenter uses a two-tier split by how you use the code:

- [MIT](licenses/LICENSE-MIT) for code you build with: the toolkit roots (`@epicenter/data`, `@epicenter/ui`) and the toolkit-internal contracts they carry (`@epicenter/field`, `@epicenter/sqlite`, `@epicenter/sync`, `@epicenter/identity`, `@epicenter/agent-protocol`, `@epicenter/chat`).
- [AGPL-3.0](licenses/LICENSE-AGPL-3.0) or later for code we ship or run: every app, the shared server library, and the rest of the internal packages.
- There is no proprietary tier today. Revenue is intended to come from hosting and services, not from selling closed licenses.

Every dependency of the toolkit packages is MIT-compatible, enforced by `bun run check:licenses`. The license split follows the same broad pattern as Plausible and PostHog for hosted open-source services, and Yjs for MIT core libraries with copyleft server pieces.

See the root [LICENSE](LICENSE), [FINANCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY.md](FINANCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY.md), and the [licensing strategy](docs/licensing/licensing-strategy.md) for the full model.

# Epicenter

Local-first personal data platform. Monorepo with Yjs CRDTs and Svelte UI.

## Structure

```
apps/
  whispering   transcription SPA, the one app on the store, and the
               reference for how an app is built
  epicenter    Tauri host for trusted app windows
packages/
  data         the store, data definitions, openers, sync, and projection
  ui           shadcn-svelte components
```

## Runtime

One runtime: a desktop SPA in a WebView over a client-owned store (ADR-0227). The host serves bundles and brokers credentials and owns no application data (ADR-0226).

ADR-0227 was executed as a clean break, so `packages/chat` and app-shell's agent chat are broken on purpose until they are rebuilt against the store, or removed with the rest of Home's chat pane.

`apps/whispering` and `apps/epicenter` are off that list: they were rebuilt. Whispering declares a real workspace with `defineData` (`src/lib/workspace/index.ts:240`), opens the device and account stores and attaches sync (`src/lib/whispering/app.ts`), and its suite runs green. Epicenter compiles, bundles, and serves. Read the remaining names as a list to re-check against the code rather than a standing fact: this file is the first thing an agent reads, and a stale entry here sends it to rebuild something that already works.

This fork carries no hosted cloud or self-host deployable: `apps/api`, `apps/self-host`, `packages/server`, and `ops/` (upstream's Cloudflare DNS and redirect tooling) were pruned because nothing in the kept apps imports them.

## License boundary

Apps are AGPL. The embeddable toolkit packages are MIT.

Moving or copying code from an AGPL package into an MIT one is a relicensing act. `bun run check:licenses` guards dependency edges only and cannot see copied source. Decision procedure: `docs/licensing/licensing-strategy.md`.

## Always use bun

Prefer `bun` over npm, yarn, pnpm, and node. Use `bun run`, `bun test`, `bun install`, and `bun x` (instead of npx).

## Local dev

Start apps from the repo root with `bun dev:<app>`. Do not cd into an app to start it.

- `bun dev:<app>` runs every process the app needs.
- `bun dev:<app>:ui` is the frontend alone, where that split exists.
- Details in the `monorepo` skill.

## Script suffix convention

The suffix tells you whether a script touches production.

| Suffix | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `:local` | works on a fresh clone without Infisical login; reads committed config like `wrangler.jsonc` |
| `:remote` | wraps with `infisical run --env=prod` and requires Infisical auth. Treat as a production admin operation. |

## Git hygiene

Stage specific files only. Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.

Do not include AI or tool attribution in commits.

## Destructive actions need approval

Force pushes, hard resets (`--hard`), branch deletions.

## External grounding

When external library behavior affects correctness, verify against DeepWiki, official docs, or local installed types before changing code.

Skip this for stable basics and repo-local patterns already documented in skills.

## Library logging

Do not use direct `console.*` in library code. Use `wellcrafted/logger`, except in CLIs, tests, and benchmarks.

## Coherent edits

Do not default to the smallest local patch.

Before changing code, prose, or agent instructions, identify the largest relevant unit whose shape controls the problem, then reconsider that unit as if the new context had always been known. The correct result may still be a small diff, but minimizing the diff is not the goal.

## Agent instruction files

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical shared instructions file.

- `CLAUDE.md` files are compatibility shims for Claude Code. They should only import a sibling `AGENTS.md` with `@AGENTS.md`, plus rare Claude-specific notes.
- Add a nested `AGENTS.md` only for a local constraint that must apply to every edit beneath it. Never use one as an index or README substitute; subsystem orientation belongs in that subsystem's README.
- When adding a nested `AGENTS.md`, add a sibling `CLAUDE.md` shim.
- Do not create orphan `CLAUDE.md` files.

## Planning docs and decisions

`docs/adr/`, `docs/CONTEXT` (create either lazily, only when the first decision or term needs one), package READMEs, tests, and current code are evidence, not automatic instructions. Start with the user's request and the current implementation.

**ADRs.** They describe decisions that were reasonable at the time, but may be stale, scoped to a different problem, or intentionally reopened. Check status, amendments, and actual code before relying on one.

- If the requested design conflicts with an ADR, do not stop automatically. Explain the conflict, then either follow the current evidence or amend/delete the ADR when the new decision is durable.
- Ask the user when the choice materially depends on product or architectural judgment that cannot be recovered from the repository, rather than silently inheriting an old decision.
- Do not cite an ADR merely because it exists. State whether it is a hard constraint, useful context, or a decision being reconsidered.

**Specs.** In-flight design scaffolding, not current truth. This holds for every `specs/` directory, top-level and per-app or per-package.

- Two states only: `Draft` and `In Progress`. "Done" is deletion, not a terminal status, so a spec still in the tree declaring `Implemented`/`Superseded` is a hygiene smell (`scripts/check-doc-hygiene.ts` flags it).
- When a design pass settles a durable decision, record it as an ADR under `docs/adr/` and delete the now-spent spec. Git keeps the body recoverable.

Treat conflicts among specs, ADRs, code, tests, and user intent as judgment points, not automatic precedence rules.

## Writing conventions

Audience decides vocabulary: what a person reads uses the word they already have, and what a developer reads uses the word that is most accurate, which is often technical and load-bearing.

| A person reads | A developer reads |
| --- | --- |
| UI copy, errors shown to them, deep links, README front doors | types, functions, library error messages |

- Do not soften `authority`, `replica`, `projection`, or `principal` in code to sound friendlier, and do not let one of them reach a person.
- A library states a failure precisely; the app decides what a person is told about it. Vocabulary decision: ADR-0244.
- Keep user-facing text direct and concrete.

**Punctuation.** Avoid en dash characters (`U+2013`). Prefer colon, comma, semicolon, or sentence break over em dash characters (`U+2014`), especially in UI strings, docs, comments, JSDoc, and commit messages.

**Explaining Epicenter work.** Lead with a useful recommendation or outcome, carry implementation complexity the agent can safely handle, and surface only the reasoning and details that materially affect the user's judgment, action, safety, or review. Necessary difficulty is fine; incidental complexity is not.

**Generated prose.** Applies to everything the agent writes unless a more specific skill owns the destination.

- Cut AI vocabulary and puffery: delve, crucial, pivotal, showcase, testament, underscore, vibrant, abstract "landscape" or "tapestry", and "serves as" or "stands as" where "is" works.
- State the point directly. No "not just X, but Y", no forced groups of three, no vague attributions like "experts believe".
- Prefer the concrete word over the abstract metaphor: substrate, wedge, vector, nexus, flywheel, north star. Load-bearing repo vocabulary is exempt: `primitive` as in the Item primitive, API `surface`, `harness`, `authority`, `replica`, `projection`, `principal`.
- Say what the thing does, not how it feels. If a sentence could appear unchanged in another project's docs, cut it.
- One idea per sentence. Active voice: name the actor ("the compiler validates queries", not "queries are validated").
- Cut adverbs and hedging; use the stronger verb or the number. "In order to" is "To"; "utilize" and "leverage" are "use".
- Formatting tells: sentence-case headings, no decorative emoji, no bold-label-colon bullets that restate the line, no chatbot phrases ("I hope this helps!", "Great question!").

Load `writing-voice` for substantial prose or explicit tone/rewrite work.

## Review posture

Be direct about flawed assumptions, weak designs, and regressions. Do not agree just to be agreeable.

## Agent collaboration

Codex is the primary continuity, judgment, execution, testing, and integration owner for repository work. It gathers the evidence, makes the final decision, edits the active worktree, and integrates the result.

Claude is an independent laboratory. Do not invoke Claude automatically because a task is complex. Invoke the `consult-claude` skill only when the user explicitly names Claude as the researcher or reviewer, or asks for a Claude Code consultation. A consultation can happen before a high-leverage decision, after a meaningful implementation slice, or at both points.

Consultation runs against a sealed snapshot: Claude may research, edit, test, and experiment there, but cannot access or author the living checkout. The `consult-claude` skill owns the isolation, native-session follow-ups, checkpoints, and review procedure.

Codex decides which feedback is valid, re-verifies it against live state, applies any changes, and reruns verification. Claude delegation never transfers live-checkout authorship.

## Review routing

Keep procedures in skills; keep `AGENTS.md` to routing.

| When | Load |
| --- | --- |
| substantial implementations, public API changes, refactors, multi-file changes, or a request to challenge, simplify, clean up, greenfield, or make a clean break | `post-implementation-review`, before final handoff or staging |
| continuous indirection-reduction work | `collapse-pass` directly |
| during review: ownership, lifecycle, API, package-boundary, clean-break, compatibility-refusal, or asymmetric-win decisions | escalate to `greenfield-clean-breaks` |
